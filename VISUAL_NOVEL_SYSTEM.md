## Usage Guide

### Basic Implementation

```csharp
// Create a scene
var scene = new VisualNovelScene
{
    Name = "My Scene",
    Layout = SceneLayout.DualCharacters,
    Theme = NovelTheme.Piltover
};

// Add characters
scene.Characters.Add(new VisualNovelCharacter
{
    Id = "jayce",
    Name = "Jayce",
    DisplayName = "Jayce Talis",
    ImagePath = "/images/Jayce.jpeg",
    Position = CharacterPosition.Left
});

// Add dialogue
scene.DialogueLines.Add(new DialogueLine
{
    CharacterId = "jayce",
    Text = "Welcome to the world of Hextech innovation!",
    AnimationType = TextAnimationType.Typewriter,
    TypewriterSpeed = 40
});
```

### Component Usage

```razor
<VisualNovel 
    Scene="@myScene" 
    Configuration="@config"
    OnStateChanged="@HandleStateChanged"
    OnSceneComplete="@HandleSceneComplete" />
```

## Configuration Options

### VisualNovelConfig

```csharp
var config = new VisualNovelConfig
{
    Theme = NovelTheme.Piltover,
    ShowSkipButton = true,
    ShowContinueButton = true,
    ShowAutoPlayButton = false,
    EnableSoundEffects = true,
    EnableBackgroundMusic = true,
    DefaultTypewriterSpeed = 50,
