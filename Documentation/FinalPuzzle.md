}

public enum DebateTurn
{
    Jinx,
    Silco,
    PlayerA,
    PlayerB
}

public enum PlayerRole
{
    Piltover,
    Zaunite
}
```

#### Main Game Class
```csharp
public class FinalPuzzleGame
{
    // Game Management
    public string RoomId { get; set; }
    public FinalPuzzleGameState State { get; set; }
    public ConcurrentDictionary<string, PlayerRole> Players { get; set; }

private async Task SimulateAIResponse(string roomId, FinalPuzzleGame game)

// Create pre-built debate dialogue
private List<DebateDialogue> CreateDebateDialogue()
```

### Debate Dialogue Flow

The debate follows a structured 9-dialogue sequence:

1. **Jinx Opening** (Index 0)
   - "Well, well, well... Look who finally made it to my little party! Did you enjoy the breadcrumbs I left for you?"

2. **Silco Response** (Index 1)
   - "Jinx, enough theatrics. These two have proven themselves resourceful. Let's see if they can handle the truth."

3. **Jinx Challenge** (Index 2)
   - "Oh, but where's the fun in that? I want to hear what they think they know first."

4. **Player A Response** (Index 3)
   - **Piltover Player Turn**: Recording prompt appears
   - Player records and submits response

5. **Silco Question** (Index 4)
   - "Interesting. And what about you, Zaunite? What's your take on all this?"

6. **Player B Response** (Index 5)
   - **Zaunite Player Turn**: Recording prompt appears
   - Player records and submits response

7. **Jinx Reaction** (Index 6)
   - "Now THIS is getting interesting! You two are smarter than I gave you credit for. But do you really understand what you've uncovered?"

8. **Silco Wisdom** (Index 7)
   - "The truth is rarely what it seems. You've seen the surface, but the depths run much deeper than you imagine."

9. **Jinx Final Question** (Index 8)
   - "So here's the real question: now that you know what you know, what are you going to do about it?"

## Multiplayer Synchronization

### SignalR Events

#### Client-Side Event Handlers
```csharp
// Player joins game
hubConnection.On<FinalPuzzlePlayerView>("FinalPuzzleGameJoined", async (playerView) => {
    UpdatePlayerView(playerView);
    StateHasChanged();
});

// Game state updates
hubConnection.On<FinalPuzzleGameStateData>("FinalPuzzleGameStateUpdated", async (gameState) => {
    UpdateGameState(gameState);
    StateHasChanged();
});

// Player view updates
hubConnection.On<FinalPuzzlePlayerView>("FinalPuzzlePlayerViewUpdated", async (playerView) => {
    UpdatePlayerView(playerView);
    StateHasChanged();
});

// Game completion
hubConnection.On<string>("FinalPuzzleGameCompleted", async (message) => {
    gameState = GameState.Completed;
    StateHasChanged();
});

// Error handling
hubConnection.On<string>("FinalPuzzleError", async (error) => {
    statusMessage = error;
    StateHasChanged();
});
```

### State Management

#### Player View Updates
```csharp
private void UpdatePlayerView(FinalPuzzlePlayerView playerView)
{
    playerRole = playerView.PlayerRole;
    isPlayerTurn = playerView.IsPlayerTurn;
    showRecordingControls = playerView.ShowRecordingControls;
    showTextControls = playerView.ShowTextControls;
    canContinue = playerView.CanContinue;
    isTextAnimating = playerView.CanSkip;
}
```

#### Game State Updates
```csharp
private void UpdateGameState(FinalPuzzleGameStateData gameState)
{
    connectedPlayersCount = gameState.ConnectedPlayersCount;
    currentSpeaker = gameState.CurrentSpeaker;
    currentSpeakerName = gameState.CurrentSpeakerName;
    displayedText = gameState.DisplayedText;
    isTextAnimating = gameState.IsTextAnimating;
    isTextFullyDisplayed = gameState.IsTextFullyDisplayed;
    isProcessing = gameState.IsProcessingResponse;
    
    // Update game state enum
    this.gameState = gameState.State switch
    {
        FinalPuzzleGameState.WaitingForPlayers => GameState.WaitingForPlayers,
        FinalPuzzleGameState.InDebate => GameState.InDebate,
        FinalPuzzleGameState.Completed => GameState.Completed,
        _ => GameState.WaitingForPlayers
    };
}
```

## Turn-Based Logic

### Server-Side Validation
```csharp
public bool CanPlayerAct(string connectionId)
{
    if (!Players.ContainsKey(connectionId))
        return false;
        
    if (!IsWaitingForPlayerResponse)
        return false;
        
    return WaitingForPlayerId == connectionId;
}
```

### Turn Progression
1. **AI Dialogue**: Jinx or Silco speaks, text animates
2. **Player Turn**: Specific player (Piltover/Zaunite) gets recording prompt
3. **Response Processing**: Player response is submitted and processed
4. **AI Response**: AI character responds to player input
5. **Continue**: Process repeats until debate completion

### UI State Management
- **Recording Controls**: Only visible to active player
- **Text Controls**: Skip/Continue buttons synchronized across players
- **Turn Indicators**: Clear visual feedback for whose turn it is
- **Waiting States**: Non-active players see "PARTNER'S TURN" message

## Voice Recording System

### Recording Flow
1. **Microphone Selection**: Player selects from available devices
2. **Recording Start**: Visual recording indicator with pulsing animation
3. **Recording Stop**: Processing indicator appears
4. **Transcription**: Placeholder for speech-to-text integration
5. **Response Submission**: Transcribed text sent to server
6. **AI Processing**: Server generates AI response

### Recording Controls
```csharp
private async Task StartRecording()
{
    isRecording = true;
    showRecordingControls = true;
    StateHasChanged();
}

private async Task StopRecording()
{
    isRecording = false;
    isProcessing = true;
    StateHasChanged();
    
    // Simulate transcription process
    await Task.Delay(2000);
    
    // Submit the transcribed text to the server
    if (hubConnection != null && !string.IsNullOrEmpty(gameCode))
    {
        var transcript = "This is where the player's transcribed speech will appear..."; // TODO: Replace with actual transcription
        await hubConnection.SendAsync("SubmitPlayerResponse", gameCode, transcript);
    }
}
```

## AI Response System

### Current Implementation
The system includes a placeholder AI response system with random responses:

```csharp
private async Task SimulateAIResponse(string roomId, FinalPuzzleGame game)
{
    await Task.Delay(2000); // Simulate processing time
    
    var aiResponses = new[]
    {
        "Oh, how touching! You think you understand what's going on here?",
        "Interesting perspective. But you're missing the bigger picture.",
        "That's exactly what I expected you to say. Predictable.",
        "You're getting closer to the truth, but not quite there yet.",
        "Very well. Let me show you what you've been missing."
    };
    
    var randomResponse = aiResponses[new Random().Next(aiResponses.Length)];
    var aiSpeaker = game.CurrentDialogueIndex % 2 == 0 ? "jinx" : "silco";
    var aiSpeakerName = aiSpeaker == "jinx" ? "Jinx" : "Silco";
    
    // Update game state with AI response
    game.CurrentSpeaker = aiSpeaker;
    game.CurrentSpeakerName = aiSpeakerName;
    game.DisplayedText = randomResponse;
    game.IsTextAnimating = true;
    game.IsTextFullyDisplayed = false;
    game.PlayerTranscript = null;
}
```

### Future Integration Points
- **OpenAI API**: Replace `SimulateAIResponse` with ChatGPT integration
- **ElevenLabs API**: Add voice synthesis for AI responses
- **Speech-to-Text**: Replace placeholder transcription with actual STT service

## Story Integration

### URL Parameters

```

### Role Preservation
- **Story Mode**: Maintains Piltover/Zaunite roles from previous scenes
- **Transition Support**: Seamless integration with story progression
- **Squad Continuity**: Preserves squad names across transitions

### Continue Story Functionality
```csharp
private async Task ContinueStory()
{
    if (hubConnection is null) return;
    try
    {
        var originalRoomId = gameCode;
        var originalSquad = string.IsNullOrEmpty(squadName)
            ? (gameCode.Contains("_") ? gameCode.Substring(0, gameCode.IndexOf("_")) : gameCode)
            : squadName;
        var targetStoryLobby = $"{originalSquad}_FromFinalPuzzle";
        var displayName = string.IsNullOrEmpty(playerNameFromUrl) ? "Player" : playerNameFromUrl;
        var canonicalRole = string.IsNullOrEmpty(playerRole) ? CanonicalizeRole(preservedRole) : playerRole;

        await hubConnection.SendAsync(
            "RedirectPlayersToAct1WithScene",
            originalRoomId,
            targetStoryLobby,
            canonicalRole,
            "1",
            displayName,
            22
        );
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"[FinalPuzzle] ContinueStory error: {ex.Message}");
    }
}
```
