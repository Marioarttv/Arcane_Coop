# Visual Novel System - Complete Implementation

## Overview

The Visual Novel System is a sophisticated narrative engine designed specifically for the Arcane-themed escape room experience. It features advanced text animation, modular character management, and dual-theme support for both Piltover and Zaun aesthetics.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **VisualNovel.razor** - Main component with full-screen immersive experience
2. **VisualNovelModels.cs** - Data models and enums for type-safe operations  
3. **VisualNovelService.cs** - Service layer for scene management and data persistence
4. **VisualNovelDemo.razor** - Demo interface for testing and showcasing features

### Multiplayer (Act 1) Integration

The Visual Novel engine powers a synchronized, two-player story intro for Act 1 via SignalR. The multiplayer page (`Components/Pages/Act1Multiplayer.razor`) mirrors the single-player experience while coordinating state with the server.

- Hub events (subset):
  - `Act1GameJoined(Act1PlayerView)`, `Act1PlayerViewUpdated(Act1PlayerView)`
  - `Act1TextSkipped()`, `Act1DialogueContinued(int)`
  - `Act1SceneTransition(string)`, `Act1RedirectToNextGame(string url)`
  - `Act1GameRestarted()`, `Act1GameCompleted()`
- Client state flags in `Act1PlayerView` control UI buttons:
  - `CanSkip` shows Skip only while text is animating
  - `CanContinue` shows Continue only when text is fully displayed
- Typing completion handshake:
  - Client calls `Act1TypingCompleted(roomId)` when a line finishes animating or is shown instantly
  - Server sets `IsTextAnimating=false`, `GameState.IsTextFullyDisplayed=true`, then broadcasts updated views
- Scene transition:
  - Server emits `Act1SceneTransition` and per-player `Act1RedirectToNextGame(/picture-explanation?...params...)`
  - Client has a 4s local fallback to navigate if a redirect is missed

## Usage Guide

### Basic Implementation

```csharp
// Create a scene
var scene = new VisualNovelScene
{
    Name = "My Scene",
    Layout = SceneLayout.DualCharacters,
    Theme = NovelTheme.Piltover
};

// Add characters with expression support
scene.Characters.Add(new VisualNovelCharacter
{
    Id = "jayce",
    Name = "Jayce",
    DisplayName = "Jayce Talis",
    ImagePath = "/images/Characters/Jayce/Jayce_default.png",
    Position = CharacterPosition.Left,
    ExpressionPaths = new Dictionary<CharacterExpression, string>
    {
        { CharacterExpression.Default, "/images/Characters/Jayce/Jayce_default.png" },
        { CharacterExpression.Happy, "/images/Characters/Jayce/Jayce_happy.png" },
        { CharacterExpression.Serious, "/images/Characters/Jayce/Jayce_serious.png" }
    }
});

// Add dialogue with expressions
scene.DialogueLines.Add(new DialogueLine
{
    CharacterId = "jayce",
    Text = "Welcome to the world of Hextech innovation!",
    AnimationType = TextAnimationType.Typewriter,
    TypewriterSpeed = 40,
    SpeakerExpression = CharacterExpression.Happy
});
```

}
```

## Advanced Features

### Enhanced Character Expression System

#### Available Expressions
```csharp
public enum CharacterExpression
{
    Default,      // Neutral/resting expression
    Happy,        // Joyful, pleased
    Sad,          // Sorrowful, dejected
    Angry,        // Furious, irritated
    Surprised,    // Shocked, amazed
    Worried,      // Anxious, concerned
    Determined,   // Focused, resolute
    Smug,         // Self-satisfied, confident
    Confused,     // Puzzled, uncertain
    Serious       // Stern, grave
}
```

#### Expression Usage Examples
```csharp
// Simple speaker expression change
new DialogueLine
{
    CharacterId = "vi",
    Text = "Shit. That's where families live, not just the Chem-Barons and their labs.",
    SpeakerExpression = CharacterExpression.Worried
}

// Multiple character expression changes
new DialogueLine
{
    CharacterId = "caitlyn",
    Text = "We need to coordinate our efforts carefully.",
    SpeakerExpression = CharacterExpression.Serious,
    CharacterExpressions = new Dictionary<string, CharacterExpression>
    {
        { "vi", CharacterExpression.Determined }
    }
}
```

#### Asset Organization Structure

### Visual Editor and Typewriter Reliability (2025 Update)

To ensure predictable behavior in multiplayer and the visual editor:

- Strong cancellation for the typewriter animation
  - `CancellationTokenSource` with explicit `CancelTypewriter()`
  - Reset `displayedText`/`currentTextIndex` before starting a new animation
  - Force a render between reset and start to prevent first-character carry-over
- Skip behavior
  - Cancels any running animation, replaces the full line text once (no duplication)
  - Calls `Act1TypingCompleted` when appropriate so buttons switch from Skip â†’ Continue automatically
- Continue behavior
  - Cancels animation, advances dialogue, then starts fresh animation on the next line

### Modular Architecture
- Service-based design
- Dependency injection
- Interface-driven development
- Easy testing and mocking

## Best Practices

### Scene Design
1. Keep dialogue lines concise (2-3 sentences max)
2. Use appropriate animation types for pacing
3. Balance character screen time in dual layouts
4. Consider theme consistency throughout scenes
5. **Use expressions strategically** to enhance emotional impact
6. **Plan expression transitions** for smooth character development

### Character Expression Management
1. **Organize assets consistently** using the `/images/Characters/{Name}/{Name}_{expression}.png` structure
2. **Set up ExpressionPaths** dictionary for each character during initialization
3. **Use SpeakerExpression** for the active character's emotion
4. **Use CharacterExpressions** to update non-speaking characters when needed
5. **Start with Default expressions** and add more as needed

### Performance
1. Preload character images for smooth transitions
2. Use appropriate typewriter speeds (30-50ms recommended)
3. Dispose of timers and resources properly
4. Test on desktop devices for performance validation
5. **Optimize expression assets** - keep consistent image sizes across expressions
6. **Use hardware acceleration** for smooth character transitions

### User Experience  
1. Provide clear visual feedback for interactions
2. Ensure skip functionality is always available
3. Use consistent theming within scene contexts
4. Consider accessibility for all users
5. **Position controls outside dialogue** to prevent text overlap
6. **Provide smooth visual transitions** for professional feel
