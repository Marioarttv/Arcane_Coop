# SignalDecoder - Communication Under Pressure

## Overview
SignalDecoder is a cooperative listening comprehension puzzle where players intercept and decode fragmented enforcer radio transmissions about the ongoing hunt for Project Safeguard scientists. Following the identification of the four targeted scientists, players discover radio chatter revealing attacks in progress and cover-ups by corrupt enforcers. One player (Piltover/Caitlyn) sees corrupted text transcripts while the other (Zaunite/Vi) receives clear audio transmissions to help complete the urgent intelligence.

**ESL-Friendly Version**: The story mode transmissions have been updated to use common, widely-known words instead of proper names and technical jargon, making the puzzle more accessible to ESL students while maintaining the same story context and gameplay mechanics.

## Game Mechanics

### Player Roles
- **Piltover (Caitlyn - Signal Interceptor)**: Sees corrupted enforcer transmissions with missing words (e.g., "Emergency: *** workshop on *** Street")
- **Zaunite (Vi - Signal Analyst)**: Receives full audio transmissions revealing the attacks on Project Safeguard scientists and Deputy Stanton's cover-up orders

### Objective
Work together under time pressure to decode the urgent enforcer transmissions revealing which scientists have been attacked, where the survivors might be hiding, and what Deputy Stanton is covering up before more lives are lost.

### Gameplay Flow
1. Both players join the same room using a shared room ID
2. First player becomes Caitlyn (Interceptor), second becomes Vi (Analyst)
3. Caitlyn sees fragmented emergency messages with missing words
4. Vi receives audio playback and technical signal data
5. Players must collaborate quickly as signals decay over time
6. Complete multiple emergency scenarios with increasing complexity

### Scoring System
- **Speed Bonus**: Points for quick completion of transmissions
- **Accuracy Bonus**: Extra points for correct decoding without errors
- **Emergency Response**: Bonus points for successfully handling crisis situations

## Story-Specific Transmissions (Act 1 Scene 3 â†’ Signal Decoder)

### Context
After identifying the four Project Safeguard scientists through the Picture Explanation puzzle, the team's confiscated enforcer radio begins crackling with urgent transmissions. Players discover that Jinx has already begun her hunt - Werner's workshop has been attacked, Dr. Renni has gone into hiding, and Deputy Stanton is actively covering up evidence. Players must decode these fragmented transmissions to understand the scope of the threat and locate the remaining scientists before it's too late.

**Note**: The transmissions below use ESL-friendly vocabulary, replacing proper names and technical terms with common words to improve accessibility for ESL students.

### Implementation Notes for Story Mode
- Transmissions should play in sequence when in story mode
- Each transmission increases in urgency and complexity
- Success on all four transmissions triggers story continuation
- Failure allows retry but maintains story context

### Dialogue Context Integration

#### Pre-Puzzle Setup (From Scene 3)
The puzzle begins after the following story beats:
- Players have identified four scientists through the Picture Explanation puzzle
- They discovered these scientists worked on "Project Safeguard"
- An enforcer radio starts crackling with emergency transmissions
- Caitlyn and Vi realize they need to decode these transmissions to find the scientists

#### Key Character Motivations
- **Caitlyn:** Needs to understand Deputy Stanton's cover-up and save the scientists
- **Vi:** Desperate to find out what Silco told Jinx about the warehouse incident
- **Players:** Must decode transmissions quickly to locate Dr. Renni before Jinx does

#### Post-Puzzle Transition (To Scene 4 - Radio Decoded)
After successfully decoding all transmissions, players have uncovered crucial intelligence:
- **Werner Confirmed Dead**: The explosion at his workshop was fatal
- **Renni Still Alive**: She wisely refused protective custody and went into hiding
- **Stanton's Corruption Exposed**: Evidence disposal and cover-up operations revealed
- **Urgent Mission**: Team must immediately head to Renni's apartment in Zaun before Jinx tracks her down
- **Time Pressure**: Every minute wasted increases the danger to the remaining scientists

The decoded transmissions reveal the full scope of Jinx's hunt and Stanton's complicity, driving the team to take immediate action to save Dr. Renni Stiltner.

### Additional Voice Lines for Story Context

#### Introduction (When joining from story)
**Caitlyn:** "The radio's picking up enforcer chatter! Quick, we need to decode this."
**Vi:** "I can hear the audio clearly. Tell me what you're seeing on the transcript."

#### Success Feedback
**Transmission 1 Success:** "Small workshop... an explosion. We're too late for them."
**Transmission 2 Success:** "The old doctor didn't report for custody. Smart person - they don't trust the deputy."
**Transmission 3 Success:** "Evidence removal? The chief's covering up the old files!"
**Transmission 4 Success:** "Project secret... all these workers are being hunted."

#### Completion
**Both Players:** "We have to find Renni before Jinx does. Her apartment in Zaun - let's go!"

## Story Integration

### Act 1 Visual Novel â†’ Signal Decoder Transition (2025 Complete Integration)

**Scene 3 to Signal Decoder Transition:**
- Server sends `Act1RedirectToNextGame` to each connection with individualized URL parameters
- Parameters include: `role`, `avatar`, `name`, `squad`, `story=true`, and `transition`
- Example URL: `/signal-decoder?role=zaun&squad=SquadAlpha_FromPicturePuzzle&transition=FromScene3&story=true`

**Role Preservation:**
- `SignalDecoder.razor` reads `role` from URL and calls `JoinSignalDecoderGameWithRole`
- Uses `AddPlayerWithRole()` game logic to maintain Piltover/Zaun assignments from story mode
- Prevents "Game is Full" errors that previously occurred during story transitions

**Story Mode Features:**
- When `story=true`, the UI immediately sets `inGame = true` to skip lobby setup
- Shows "Continue Story" button instead of "Play Again" after puzzle completion
- Seamless integration with visual novel narrative flow

### Transition Parameter System (2025 Update)

**Unique Room ID Generation:**
The Signal Decoder puzzle implements a sophisticated transition parameter system that prevents room name conflicts during story transitions.

**URL Parameter Processing:**
```csharp
// Example transition URL from Scene 3:
/signal-decoder?role=zaun&squad=SquadAlpha_FromPicturePuzzle&transition=FromScene3&story=true

// Transition parameter parsing
string transitionParam = HttpUtility.ParseQueryString(uri.Query)["transition"];
string uniqueRoomId = !string.IsNullOrEmpty(transitionParam) ? 
    $"{squadName}_{transitionParam}" : squadName;

// Result: SquadAlpha_FromPicturePuzzle_FromScene3
```

**Squad Name Extraction for Return Transition:**
```csharp
// When transitioning back to next visual novel scene
string originalSquadName = roomId.Contains("_") ? 
    roomId.Substring(0, roomId.IndexOf("_")) : roomId;
string nextPhaseRoomId = $"{originalSquadName}_FromSignalDecoder";

// From: SquadAlpha_FromPicturePuzzle_FromScene3
// Extract: SquadAlpha
// Create: SquadAlpha_FromSignalDecoder
```

**Critical Benefits:**
- **Eliminates "Game is Full" Errors**: Each story transition uses a unique room identifier
- **Preserves Squad Identity**: Original squad name maintained throughout the story flow
- **Complete Story Integration**: Fixed Scene 3 to Signal Decoder transition that previously went to Picture Explanation
- **Synchronized Navigation**: Both players join the same unique puzzle room
- **Role Continuity**: Player roles (Piltover/Zaun) preserved across story-puzzle boundaries
