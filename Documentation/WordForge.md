# Word Forge: Atlas Gauntlet Calibration System

## Overview

The **Word Forge** is a sophisticated cooperative word-building puzzle where two players must work together to calibrate Jayce's Atlas Gauntlets for Vi to use against Jinx's weapon. After successfully defusing Jinx's bomb in Jayce's workshop, the team realizes they need a counter-weapon. With Viktor too ill to help, players must follow Jayce's complex engineering specifications to forge the precise resonance frequencies needed to make the gauntlets functional.

## Game Concept

### Narrative Context
**Act 1 Scene 13 Integration**: Following the bomb defusal, Jayce reveals the Atlas Gauntlets - prototype hextech devices that can absorb and redirect hextech energy. However, without Viktor's expertise, the gauntlets remain uncalibrated. Jayce provides engineering specifications that require precise "word forging" - combining technical terms and frequency patterns to achieve the exact calibration needed for Vi to safely wear and operate the gauntlets.
