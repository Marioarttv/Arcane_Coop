Post-Bomb Defusal
Scene 13: After the Crisis
Scene ID: bomb_defused
Layout: Dual Characters
Theme: Piltover
Relief and Realization
[The bomb powers down with a mechanical whir]
Jayce (Collapsing against table):

"Oh thank the gods. I thought we were all dead."

Vi (Shaking):

"She could have killed us all. But she didn't."

Caitlyn (Analyzing):

"This was a demonstration. She's showing us what she's capable of."

[Player A Name] (Exhausted):

"That was too close."

[Player B Name] (Still tense):

"Is it really safe now?"

Jayce (Checking):

"The mechanism's completely inactive. We did it."

The Next Problem
Vi (Urgent):

"But she still has your notes. She can build her weapon."

Jayce (Despairing):

"With my stabilization formulas and the old unstable cores? She could create something devastating."

Caitlyn (Determined):

"Then we need to be ready to counter it."

[Player A Name] (Suggesting):

"What about protective equipment? Something to defend against Hextech weapons?"

The Gauntlets
Jayce (Remembering):

"Wait... Viktor and I were developing something. The Atlas Gauntlets."

Vi (Interested):

"Gauntlets?"

Jayce (Explaining):

"They can absorb and redirect Hextech energy. In theory, they could counter Jinx's weapon."

[Player B Name] (Hopeful):

"Then let's use them!"

Jayce (Frustrated):

"They're not calibrated! Viktor was supposed to help with the resonance frequencies, but he's too ill."

Vi's Decision
Vi (Stepping forward):

"I'll wear them."

Caitlyn (Concerned):

"Vi, untested Hextech could be dangerous—"

Vi (Firm):

"I don't care. If it gives me a chance to stop her... to save her... I'll take the risk."

Jayce (Considering):

"The calibration process is complex. I'll need help. I can't do it alone."

[Player A Name] (Volunteering):

"Tell us what to do."

[Player B Name] (Ready):

"We've come this far. We're not stopping now."

Setting Up the Forge
Jayce (Moving to forge):

"The gauntlets are here, in the prototype vault. They're almost complete, just need final calibration."

[He retrieves massive metal gauntlets, humming with dormant energy]
Vi (Awed):

"They're beautiful."

Jayce (Explaining):

"But deadly if miscalibrated. We need to input the exact forging sequence."

Caitlyn (To players):

"You two have been incredible so far. Can you handle this?"

[Player A Name] (Confident):

"Just tell me what to look for."

[Player B Name] (At forge controls):

"I'm ready at the interface."

The Calibration Process
Jayce (Instructing):

"[Player A Name], I'll give you the engineering specifications. You'll need to relay them."

Jayce (Continuing):

"[Player B Name], you'll input the commands at the forge based on those specifications."

Vi (Impatient):

"How long will this take?"

Jayce (Working):

"Not long if we do it right. Too long if we do it wrong and have to start over."

Caitlyn (Encouraging):

"You can do this. Both of you. I've seen what you're capable of."
