Scene ID: warehouse_approach
Layout: Dual Characters
Theme: Zaun
Location: Abandoned Warehouse District
Return to the Past
Vi (Stopping at entrance):

"This is it. Where everything went wrong seven years ago."

Caitlyn (Placing hand on Vi's shoulder):

"Are you sure you're ready for this?"

Vi (Steeling herself):

"I have to be. For Powder."

[Player A Name] (Looking around):

"The place looks different. More run down, but... there are lights inside."

[Player B Name] (Noticing):

"Fresh shimmer tracks everywhere. Multiple sets. Jinx has been here a lot."

Voices Inside
[They creep closer, hearing voices through broken windows]
Jinx's Voice (Muffled but audible):

"It's ready, Silco! The weapon that'll make them pay for what they did to Vander!"

Silco's Voice (Calm):

"Excellent work, Jinx. With the scientists' cooperation, we finally have all the pieces."

Vi (Whispering, shocked):

"Scientists' cooperation? But she thinks they're dead..."

Caitlyn (Whispering):

"Listen..."

The Fatal Slip
Jinx's Voice (Confused):

"Cooperation? But... you said they fled. You said they were gone."

Silco's Voice (Trying to recover):

"I meant their notes, their research—"

Jinx's Voice (Rising):

"You said they DISAPPEARED. That they were too scared to face justice. But cooperation means... where are they, Silco? WHERE ARE THEY?"

[Player A Name] (Whispering):

"She's figuring it out."

[Player B Name] (Urgent):

"We need to get in there."

Entering the Warehouse
[Vi kicks open the door]
Vi (Loud):

"Powder!"

[Inside: Jinx spins around, weapon in hand. Silco stands near a table covered in papers]
Jinx (Shocked, then angry):

"Vi?! What are you doing here? And with... with THEM?"

[Gestures at Caitlyn and the players]
Silco (Composed but tense):

"Well. The prodigal sister returns."

The Standoff
Caitlyn (Weapon raised):

"Put the weapon down, Jinx."

Jinx (Laughing manically):

"Jinx? JINX?! Even you're calling me that now, Vi?"

Vi (Desperate):

"Powder, please. You need to listen—"

Jinx (Screaming):

"DON'T call me that! Powder's DEAD! You left her to die!"

Vi (Pleading):

"I didn't leave you! I was taken! Marcus arrested me that night!"

The Truth Begins
Jinx (Faltering):

"No... no, you abandoned me. You said I was a jinx and you LEFT!"

Silco (Interjecting):

"Jinx, don't listen to her. She's trying to confuse you—"

[Player A Name] (Stepping forward):

"We have proof! Evidence about what really happened that night!"

[Player B Name] (Supporting):

"About the warehouse, about the explosion. The real truth."

Jinx (Conflicted):

"Shut up! SHUT UP! Silco told me the truth! The scientists stored Hextech cores! They killed Vander!"

Setting Up the Revelation
Vi (Firm):

"That's a lie, Powder. And we can prove it."

Caitlyn (To players):

"Show her. Show her everything we found."

[Player A Name] (Determined):

"We've collected evidence from all over the city."

[Player B Name] (Ready):

"Police reports, witness accounts, scientific records."

Jinx (Wavering):

"I don't... I don't want to hear this..."

Vi (Gentle but urgent):

"You need to. Please, Powder. Just look at the evidence."


Detective Puzzle Setup
Scene 16: The Truth About That Night
Scene ID: truth_revealed
Layout: Special Evidence Display
Theme: Zaun
Presenting the Evidence
[Player A Name] (Showing first piece):

"Enforcer report from that night: 'Hextech residue detected matches signature of crystals stolen from Jayce Talis apartment - no additional cores found.'"

Jinx (Shaking):

"That's... that's not possible..."

[Player B Name] (Showing second piece):

"Witness account: 'Blue-haired girl ran toward warehouse carrying a monkey toy with blue glow.'"

Jinx (Defensive):

"They're lying! They have to be lying!"

More Evidence
[Player A Name] (Continuing):

"Jayce's testimony: 'The crystals they stole were more than enough to cause that explosion. Those were refined, concentrated Hextech.'"

Silco (Trying to intervene):

"Jinx, these are fabrications—"

[Player B Name] (Showing ledger):

"Silco's own ledger: 'Scientists acquired Days 3, 7, 12, 15 - Holding at secondary location - alive for questioning.'"

Jinx (To Silco):

"Alive? You said they were dead! You said they fled!"

The Critical Evidence
[Player A Name] (Final piece):

"Heimerdinger's sealed records: 'All prototype cores from failed experiments destroyed six months prior to incident.'"

[Player B Name] (Final revelation):

"Renni's notes: 'We warned them about hex crystal instability with chemical compounds - they ignored us. We tried to prevent accidents like this.'"

The Breaking Point
Vi (Stepping closer):

"Your bomb worked, Powder. The hex crystals you put in it... they were enough. More than enough."

Jinx (Breaking down):

"No... no, the crystals weren't strong enough... Silco said they weren't enough..."

Silco (Desperate):

"Jinx, they're lying. Your bomb was small, the crystals were just—"

Jayce's Voice (If present via recording or Player A reading):

"Those crystals could power an entire mining operation. In a bomb... I'm sorry."

The Complete Breakdown
Jinx (Dropping weapon, clutching head):

"The voices said... Mylo said it wasn't... but it WAS! IT WAS ME!"

[She sees hallucinations intensifying]
Jinx (Screaming):

"I put the crystals in! I made it work! I MADE IT WORK TOO WELL!"

Vi (Reaching out):

"Powder—"

Jinx (Hysterical):

"All this time... all these people... for nothing... for a LIE!"

Confronting Silco
Jinx (Whirling on Silco):

"You KNEW! You let me believe—"

Silco (Finally honest):

"I was protecting you! The guilt would have destroyed you!"

Jinx (Rage and pain):

"So you let me destroy THEM instead?!"

[Player A Name] (Urgent):

"The scientists are still alive, Jinx. You can still save them."

[Player B Name] (Hopeful):

"It's not too late to make this right."

The Choice
Vi (Emotional):

"Powder, I know the truth hurts. But you're not alone. You never were."

Jinx (Sobbing):

"I killed them... Mylo, Claggor, Vander... I killed them all..."

Silco (Soft):

"You're perfect, Jinx. Even now—"

Jinx (Screaming):

"STOP LYING TO ME!"

[She grabs her weapon, pointing it wildly at everyone]
Player Choice Moment
Caitlyn (To players):

"We need to help her. What do we do?"

Choice for Player A:
Text Options:

"Help Silco escape - he knows where the scientists are"
"Try to calm Jinx down with words"
"Secure the weapon before she hurts someone"

Choice for Player B:
Text Options:

"Get between Vi and Jinx to protect them both"
"Find and free the scientists while everyone's distracted"
"Call for enforcer backup"

The Resolution
Vi (Based on choices, either comforting or desperate):

"Powder, please. Whatever happens next, know that I never stopped loving you. I never stopped looking for you."

Jinx (Depending on player choices):

"It's too late, Vi. Powder's gone. There's only Jinx now."

[Or if players chose well]
Jinx (Broken but listening):

"Vi... I... I don't know who I am anymore..."
