Scene 14: The Atlas Gauntlets Complete
Scene ID: gauntlets_complete
Layout: Dual Characters
Theme: Piltover
Success
[The gauntlets pulse with blue Hextech energy]
Jayce (Triumphant):

"It worked! The calibration is perfect!"

Vi (Putting them on):

"They're... incredible. I can feel the power."

[Vi flexes her fingers, the gauntlets responding instantly]
Caitlyn (Impressed):

"The way they move... it's like they're part of you."

[Player A Name] (Proud):

"We did it. We actually did it."

[Player B Name] (Relieved):

"Now we have a fighting chance against Jinx's weapon."

The Moment of Truth
Jayce (Serious):

"These gauntlets can absorb Hextech energy and redirect it. But Vi, you need to be careful."

Vi (Testing them):

"They feel right. Like they were meant for me."

Jayce (Quietly):

"Viktor would say... use them to protect, not just to punish. I hope he recovers in time to see them in action."

Vi (Solemn):

"I know what I have to do. Protect the family. Protect Powder, even from herself."

New Information
[Player A's radio crackles urgently]
Radio Voice:

"All units... disturbance at warehouse district... reports of... Silco's men moving... large gathering..."

Caitlyn (Alert):

"The warehouse district? That's where—"

Vi (Realizing):

"Where Vander died. Where it all went wrong."

[Player A Name] (Listening):

"They're saying something about a meeting. Silco and... someone else."

[Player B Name] (Worried):

"You think it's Jinx?"

The Final Push
Vi (Determined):

"It has to be. She's going back to where it all started."

Caitlyn (Strategic):

"This could be our chance. If we can get there before—"

Vi (Already moving):

"Before she does something she can't take back. Let's go."

Jayce (Warning):

"Be careful! The gauntlets are powerful but they're not invincible!"

[Player A Name] (Following):

"We're with you, Vi."

[Player B Name] (Determined):

"All the way. Let's finish this."

Vi (Looking at gauntlets):

"Hold on, Powder. I'm coming. This time, I won't let you down."
