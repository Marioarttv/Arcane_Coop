Layout: Dual Characters

Location: Abandoned Shimmer Refinement Facility
Outside the Factory
Vi (Surveying damage):

"The explosion came from the upper levels. But the structure's still standing."

Caitlyn (Cautious):

"For now. This whole place could come down."

[Player B Name] (Worried):

"Purple smoke everywhere. That's shimmer residue. We shouldn't breathe too much of it."

[Player A Name] (Spotting something):

"Look! Over there by the entrance!"

[They rush over to find a hand-drawn map weighted down by a rock]
Caitlyn (Examining):

"It's hand-drawn. Recently too - the ink's still fresh in places."

Vi (Recognizing):

"This is Renni's handwriting. She mapped the place out."

[Player B Name] (Reading notes):

"She marked locations... 'Main processing,' 'Storage tanks,' and... 'Holding cells - Level 3.'"

[Player A Name] (Grim):

"Holding cells. That's where she thought the scientists were."

Planning the Approach
Vi (Determined):

"Then that's where we go."

Caitlyn (Strategic):

"Wait. We can't all go barging in. The place is probably full of Silco's goons."

[Player A Name] (Studying map):

"According to this, there are multiple routes through the factory. Maintenance tunnels, catwalks..."

[Player B Name] (Worried):

"I could scout ahead, but I don't know the layout."

Vi (Deciding):

"[Player B Name], you go in first. You're quicker, quieter. [Player A Name], you guide them using Renni's map."

Caitlyn (Agreeing):

"Vi and I will create a distraction if needed. Draw any guards away."

Setting Up Navigation
[Player A Name] (Holding map):

"Okay, I've got the map. There's an entrance through a maintenance hatch about twenty meters to your left."

[Player B Name] (Ready):

"I see it. Looks clear."

Vi (Urgent):

"Be careful in there. And if you see Jinx..."

[Player B Name] (Understanding):

"I'll signal you. I won't engage alone."

Caitlyn (To Player A):

"Guide them carefully. One wrong turn in there and they could walk right into a patrol."

[Player A Name] (Focused):

"According to the map, once you're inside, there should be a corridor straight ahead."

[Player B Name] (Entering):

"I'm in. It's dark. Pipes everywhere. Which way?"
