Layout: Dual Characters

Success
[Player B Name] (Excited):

"It worked! The potion's glowing bright blue!"

[Player A Name] (Relieved):

"Perfect! Now splash some on the ground. See if it reveals anything."

[Player B splashes the potion]
[Player B Name] (Amazed):

"Oh my god... footprints! Glowing purple footprints everywhere!"

Vi (Urgent):

"Jinx. She's been micro-dosing shimmer."

Caitlyn (Concerned):

"That's dangerous. Shimmer addiction can cause permanent damage."

[Player B Name] (Following trail):

"The footprints are recent. They lead out of here and... up?"

Following the Trail
[Vi and Caitlyn enter the lab]
Vi (Taking the potion):

"Good work. Both of you."

Caitlyn (Examining tracks):

"These are fresh. Maybe a few hours old at most."

[Player A Name] (Worried):

"So Jinx was here after Renni?"

Vi (Grim):

"Or at the same time. Come on, let's follow the trail."

[Player B Name] (Pointing):

"It leads to that stairwell. Goes up several floors."

Discovering the Path
Caitlyn (Strategic):

"Stay alert. We're tracking her, but she could be anywhere."

Vi (Emotional):

"After all these years... we can finally find her."

[They follow the glowing footprints through the factory]
[Player A Name] (Noticing):

"The trail's getting stronger. More shimmer concentration."

[Player B Name] (Worried):

"She's using more and more. That can't be good for her."

Vi (Pained):

"Powder, what have you done to yourself?"

Caitlyn (Supportive):

"We'll find her, Vi. We'll help her."

Trail Leads Out
[Player B Name] (At exit):

"The trail leads outside. Across the district towards..."

[Player A Name] (Recognizing direction):

"That's towards the old arcade district. The abandoned sections."

Vi (Knowing):

"She'd go somewhere familiar. Somewhere that meant something."

Caitlyn (Determined):

"Then that's where we go. We're close now."

[Player B Name] (Cautious):

"What if it's a trap? What if she knows we're following?"

Vi (Resolute):

"Then we spring it. I'm not losing her again."
