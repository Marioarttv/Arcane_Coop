Scene ID: empty_cells
Layout: Dual Characters
Theme: Zaun
Discovery
[Player B Name] (Disappointed):

"I'm here but... the cells are empty. Just chains and... is that blood?"

[Player A Name] (Worried):

"Empty? But there are signs people were there?"

[Player B Name] (Investigating):

"Food scraps, water bowls... and someone's glasses, broken on the floor."

Vi (Over comms):

"They were moved. Recently by the sounds of it."

Caitlyn (Analyzing):

"Or taken somewhere else. Can you see anything else?"

[Player B Name] (Looking around):

"Wait, there's a room adjoining the cells. Looks like... a laboratory?"

The Laboratory Discovery
[Player B Name] (Entering lab):

"This place is full of equipment. Beakers, burners, and... tons of papers everywhere."

[Player A Name] (Curious):

"What kind of papers?"

[Player B Name] (Reading):

"Recipes. Chemical formulas. Most of it's about shimmer refinement, but..."
[Picks up specific paper]
"Here's something different. 'Shimmer Residue Tracer - For tracking subjects exposed to concentrated shimmer.'"

Vi (Excited):

"A tracking potion? If Jinx has been using shimmer..."

Caitlyn (Realizing):

"We could track her. Find where she's been, where she's going."

[Player A Name] (Urgent):

"Can you make it? Is the equipment there working?"

[Player B Name] (Checking):

"The equipment's functional. Silco's crew must have been using this recently. But I don't know chemistry."

Setting Up Alchemy Lab
[Player A Name] (Determined):

"I can read the recipe to you. Tell you what to mix."

[Player B Name] (Unsure):

"Are you sure? One wrong mixture and this could explode."

Vi (Encouraging):

"You can do this. Both of you. We need that tracer."

Caitlyn (Warning):

"But be precise. Shimmer's volatile even in small amounts."

[Player A Name] (Reading recipe):

"Okay, first ingredient: Two parts diluted shimmer base. Do you see anything labeled like that?"

[Player B Name] (Looking):

"Yes! Purple liquid in a sealed container. Got it."

Vi (Keeping watch):

"Work fast. We don't know when Jinx or Silco's people might come back."
