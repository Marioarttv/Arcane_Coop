Scene ID: jayce_workshop_arrival
Layout: Dual Characters
Theme: Piltover
Location: Academy District, Jayce's Workshop
Racing Against Time
Caitlyn (Running):

"The Academy should be just ahead!"

Vi (Urgent):

"The lights are still on in Jayce's workshop. Good, he's there."

[Player A Name] (Worried):

"But it's too quiet. The Academy's usually bustling even at night."

[Player B Name] (Noticing):

"The door to the workshop... it's ajar."

Vi (Alarmed):

"No. We're too late."

Entering the Workshop
[They burst through the door]
Vi (Calling out):

"Jayce! JAYCE!"

Jayce (From behind overturned table):

"Vi? Caitlyn? Thank the gods you're here!"

Caitlyn (Relieved):

"You're alive! We thought—"

Jayce (Frantic):

"She was here! The blue-haired girl! She took everything!"

The Theft
[Player A Name] (Looking around):

"The place is ransacked."

Jayce (Panicking):

"My stabilization notes, the frequency calibrations, even the prototype crystals - all gone!"

[Player B Name] (Concerned):

"How long ago?"

Jayce (Frustrated):

"Maybe an hour? I was in the back room when I heard the explosion. By the time I got here..."

Vi (Checking the shimmer tracer):

"The footprints. They're fresh. She's been all over this room."

The Discovery
Caitlyn (Noticing):

"Jayce, where's Viktor? Shouldn't he be here?"

Jayce (Sad):

"He's been bedridden for days. His illness... it's getting worse. I've been trying to finish our work alone."

[Player A Name] (Realizing):

"That's why Jinx struck now. She knew you'd be alone."

Jayce (Looking at floor):

"Wait... look at the floor. What's that glow?"

[Player B Name] (Following trail):

"The shimmer trail! It leads... behind the main forge?"

Finding the Bomb
Vi (Approaching carefully):

"Everyone stay back. Let me check—"

Jayce (Gasping):

"Oh gods. Is that...?"

[Behind the forge - a complex device with Jinx's monkey symbol]
Caitlyn (Horrified):

"It's a bomb. Everyone out, NOW!"

Jayce (Stopping):

"No! Wait! If that detonates here..."
