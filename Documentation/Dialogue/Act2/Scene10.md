Scene 10: Following the Trail
Scene ID: following_jinx_trail
Layout: Dual Characters
Theme: Zaun
Location: Abandoned Arcade District
Approaching the Hideout
Vi (Recognizing area):

"I know this place. We used to come here as kids. Before everything went wrong."

[Player B Name] (Looking around):

"It's completely abandoned now. Been that way for years."

Caitlyn (Observing trail):

"The footprints are everywhere here. She comes and goes frequently."

[Player A Name] (Spotting):

"Look - they converge on that old arcade. 'Jericho's Games.'"

Vi (Emotional):

"Powder loved that place. She'd spend hours trying to beat the high scores."

Entering the Arcade
[They carefully enter the abandoned arcade]
[Player B Name] (Whispering):

"It's quiet. Too quiet."

Caitlyn (Alert):

"She's not here. But this is definitely her space."

Vi (Looking around):

"My god... look at this place."

Discovering the Workshop
[Player A Name] (Amazed):

"The walls... they're covered in drawings. Equations. Schematics."

[Player B Name] (Disturbed):

"And these mannequins... they're dressed like people. Is that one supposed to be you, Vi?"

Vi (Pained):

"She made a whole fake family. Look - there's Mylo, Claggor... even Vander."

Caitlyn (Gentle):

"Vi, I'm sorry. This must be—"

Vi (Cutting off):

"Look at the workbench. Those are bombs. Lots of them."

Finding the Evidence
[Player A Name] (At desk):

"Guys, you need to see this. There are photos here."

[Player B Name] (Looking):

"The four scientists. All marked with 'MURDERERS' in red paint."

Caitlyn (Reading papers):

"And these documents... 'Proof of Hextech cores stored in Vander's warehouse.' But these are forgeries."

Vi (Angry):

"Silco. He made her believe the explosion wasn't her fault."

The False Evidence
[Player A Name] (Reading):

"Listen to this: 'The scientists stored illegal Hextech cores in civilian buildings. When exposed to crude explosives, caused catastrophic chain reaction.'"

[Player B Name] (Confused):

"But that's not what happened, right?"

Vi (Emotional):

"No. It was Powder's bomb. The hex crystals she put in it from Jayce's apartment. They caused the explosion."

Caitlyn (Understanding):

"Silco convinced her otherwise. Made her think these scientists were responsible for Vander's death."

Finding the Plans
[Player A Name] (Urgent):

"There's more. Look at these schematics."

[Player B Name] (Reading):

"She's planning something big. Combining old Hextech cores with... 'J's stabilization matrix?'"

Caitlyn (Realizing):

"Jayce's stabilization notes. She's planning to steal from his workshop."

Vi (Finding note):

"Here - 'Topsider working alone now - partner sick - perfect timing.' She knows Viktor is ill."

The Timeline
[Player A Name] (Checking plans):

"According to this, she's planning the raid... tonight? No, wait - tomorrow night."

[Player B Name] (Worried):

"That doesn't give us much time."

Caitlyn (Determined):

"We need to warn Jayce immediately."

Vi (Staring at drawing):

"Look at this drawing. It's all of us - me, Powder, Mylo, Claggor, Vander. But Vander's face is circled in red."

The Painful Truth
[Player B Name] (Reading notation):

"'I'll make them pay for you.' She really believes she's avenging him."

Vi (Breaking):

"She doesn't know. After all these years, she doesn't know the truth."

Caitlyn (Supportive):

"Silco protected her from the guilt. In his twisted way, he was trying to help her."

[Player A Name] (Finding journal):

"There's a journal here. Listen: 'Silco says I'm perfect. Says the voices are just trying to make me weak. But they won't stop screaming.'"

Vi (Horrified):

"Voices? She's hearing voices?"

The Revelation
[Player B Name] (Continuing to read):

"'Mylo says I'm still a jinx. Claggor says Vi will never forgive me. But Silco says they're lying. Says Vi abandoned me because she was weak.'"

Vi (Anguished):

"No... no, I didn't abandon her. I was taken. Marcus arrested me that night."

Caitlyn (Realizing):

"She doesn't know that either. She thinks you chose to leave."

[Player A Name] (Finding recent entry):

"This entry is from yesterday: 'Saw Vi on the bridge with an enforcer. She replaced me. Found a new sister. Silco was right - she never loved me.'"

Vi (Desperate):

"We have to find her. I have to explain—"

The Urgency
Caitlyn (Practical):

"First we stop her from stealing Jayce's notes. If she builds this weapon..."

[Player B Name] (Looking at schematics):

"It would be devastating. Combine the instability of old cores with modern stabilization?"

[Player A Name] (Grim):

"She could level a city block. Maybe more."

Vi (Determined):

"Then we go to Jayce. Now. Before she has everything she needs."

Leaving the Lair
[As they prepare to leave, Vi takes one last look]
Vi (Quietly):

"She kept this."
[Holds up a small bunny toy]
"I gave this to her when she was five. Told her it would protect her from monsters."

Caitlyn (Gentle):

"She still has it. That means something, Vi."

[Player B Name] (Urgent):

"We should go. If Jinx comes back..."

[Player A Name] (Agreeing):

"Right. Jayce's workshop. We need to move."

Vi (Placing bunny back):

"We'll save you, Powder. I promise. This time I won't fail you."
