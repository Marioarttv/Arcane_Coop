Scene ID: truth_revealed
Layout: Special Evidence Display
Theme: Zaun
Presenting the Evidence
[Player A Name] (Showing first piece):

"Enforcer report from that night: 'Hextech residue detected matches signature of crystals stolen from Jayce Talis apartment - no additional cores found.'"

Jinx (Shaking):

"That's... that's not possible..."

[Player B Name] (Showing second piece):

"Witness account: 'Blue-haired girl ran toward warehouse carrying a monkey toy with blue glow.'"

Jinx (Defensive):

"They're lying! They have to be lying!"

More Evidence
[Player A Name] (Continuing):

"Jayce's testimony: 'The crystals they stole were more than enough to cause that explosion. Those were refined, concentrated Hextech.'"

Silco (Trying to intervene):

"Jinx, these are fabrications—"

[Player B Name] (Showing ledger):

"Silco's own ledger: 'Scientists acquired Days 3, 7, 12, 15 - Holding at secondary location - alive for questioning.'"

Jinx (To Silco):

"Alive? You said they were dead! You said they fled!"

The Critical Evidence
[Player A Name] (Final piece):

"Heimerdinger's sealed records: 'All prototype cores from failed experiments destroyed six months prior to incident.'"

[Player B Name] (Final revelation):

"Renni's notes: 'We warned them about hex crystal instability with chemical compounds - they ignored us. We tried to prevent accidents like this.'"

The Breaking Point
Vi (Stepping closer):

"Your bomb worked, Powder. The hex crystals you put in it... they were enough. More than enough."

Jinx (Breaking down):

"No... no, the crystals weren't strong enough... Silco said they weren't enough..."

Silco (Desperate):

"Jinx, they're lying. Your bomb was small, the crystals were just—"

Jayce's Voice (If present via recording or Player A reading):

"Those crystals could power an entire mining operation. In a bomb... I'm sorry."

The Complete Breakdown
Jinx (Dropping weapon, clutching head):

"The voices said... Mylo said it wasn't... but it WAS! IT WAS ME!"

[She sees hallucinations intensifying]
Jinx (Screaming):

"I put the crystals in! I made it work! I MADE IT WORK TOO WELL!"

Vi (Reaching out):

"Powder—"

Jinx (Hysterical):

"All this time... all these people... for nothing... for a LIE!"

Confronting Silco
Jinx (Whirling on Silco):

"You KNEW! You let me believe—"

Silco (Finally honest):

"I was protecting you! The guilt would have destroyed you!"

Jinx (Rage and pain):

"So you let me destroy THEM instead?!"

[Player A Name] (Urgent):

"The scientists are still alive, Jinx. You can still save them."

[Player B Name] (Hopeful):

"It's not too late to make this right."

The Choice
Vi (Emotional):

"Powder, I know the truth hurts. But you're not alone. You never were."

Jinx (Sobbing):

"I killed them... Mylo, Claggor, Vander... I killed them all..."

Silco (Soft):

"You're perfect, Jinx. Even now—"

Jinx (Screaming):

"STOP LYING TO ME!"

[She grabs her weapon, pointing it wildly at everyone]

Jinx (Depending on player choices):

"It's too late, Vi. Powder's gone. There's only Jinx now."

Jinx (Broken but listening):

"Vi... I... I don't know who I am anymore..."
