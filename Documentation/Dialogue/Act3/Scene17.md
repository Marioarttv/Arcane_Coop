Scene ID: final_resolution
Layout: Dual Characters
Theme: Zaun
Location: Warehouse - After the Confrontation
Immediate Aftermath
[Based on player choices, the scene begins differently]
Path A: If Players Chose to Help Jinx
Jinx (Collapsed, sobbing):

"I can't... I can't undo what I did..."

Vi (Kneeling beside her):

"No. But you can choose what happens next."

Silco (If still present):

"Jinx, we need to leave. Now."

Jinx (Looking at Silco):

"No. No more running. No more lies."

[Player A Name] (Supportive):

"The scientists are still alive. Tell us where they are."

Jinx (Weak):

"Shimmer factory... underwater level... Silco's private cells..."

Path B: If Players Chose to Stop Silco
Silco (Captured/Cornered):

"You're making a mistake. Without me, Zaun will fall apart."

Caitlyn (Firm):

"Zaun will find its own way. Without your poison."

[Player B Name] (Demanding):

"Where are the scientists?"

Silco (Defiant):

"Gone. You'll never—"

Jinx (Interrupting):

"Underwater level. Shimmer factory. I... I heard him talking about it."

The Scientists' Location
Vi (To players):

"Can you get to them? Caitlyn and I need to handle things here."

[Player A Name] (Determined):

"We're on it."

[Player B Name] (Already moving):

"Those people have been through enough. Let's go."

Caitlyn (Grateful):

"Be careful. There might still be guards."

While Players Are Gone (Intercut)
Vi (To Jinx):

"Powder... Jinx... whoever you are now. I'm sorry."

Jinx (Bitter laugh):

"You're sorry? I killed them, Vi. I killed our family."

Vi (Emotional):

"And I wasn't there to help you through it. We both carry that weight."

Silco (If conscious):

"She doesn't need your pity."

Vi (Fierce):

"She needs the truth. Something you never gave her."

Players Return
[Player A Name] (Returning, out of breath):

"We found them! The scientists - they're alive but weak."

[Player B Name] (Relief):

"Medical teams are on the way. They're going to be okay."

Jinx (Surprised):

"They're... alive? I didn't... I didn't kill them too?"

Caitlyn (Gentle):

"No. You scared them, hurt them maybe, but they're alive."

The Decision
Vi (To Jinx):

"You have a choice now. Come with us. Face what you've done. Try to heal."

Jinx (Lost):

"Or what? Go back to prison? Be executed?"

Caitlyn (Intervening):

"Or get help. Real help. The things you've been through... no one should face that alone."

[Player A Name] (Adding):

"The scientists... they want to speak for you. They know you were manipulated."

[Player B Name] (Supportive):

"Renni especially. She says you're a victim too."

Silco's Fate
[If Silco is still present]
Silco (To Jinx):

"You're going to leave me? After everything I've done for you?"

Jinx (Finally strong):

"You lied to me. You used me. You... you loved me, in your way. But it was poison."

Silco (Desperate):

"I saved you when she abandoned you!"

Vi (Firm):

"I never abandoned her. And now I'm here to save her from you."

[Enforcers arrive to arrest Silco, or he escapes depending on earlier choices]
The Goodbye
Jinx (To Vi):

"I can't go with you. Not yet. Maybe... maybe not ever."

Vi (Tearful):

"Powder—"

Jinx (Soft):

"I'm not Powder anymore. But... maybe I'm not just Jinx either."

[She starts to leave]
Vi (Calling out):

"Where will you go?"

Jinx (Pausing):

"To figure out who I am. When I'm not being someone else's weapon."

[She looks at the players]
Jinx (To players):

"Thank you. For showing me the truth. Even if it hurts."

Final Resolution
[After Jinx leaves]
Caitlyn (Comforting Vi):

"She'll be back. When she's ready."

Vi (Watching Jinx disappear):

"I know. And I'll be waiting."

[Player A Name] (Hopeful):

"The scientists are safe. The weapon's been secured. That's a win."

[Player B Name] (Realistic):

"And Zaun? What happens now without Silco?"

Vi (Determined):

"We help them rebuild. The right way this time."

Epilogue - Back at the Last Drop
[Scene transition to a few days later]
Vi (To players):

"I wanted to thank you both. Without you, we never would have uncovered the truth."

Caitlyn (Agreeing):

"You two make quite a team. Piltover and Zaun, working together."

[Player A Name] (Modest):

"We just did what needed to be done."

[Player B Name] (Smiling):

"Besides, someone had to keep you two from killing each other at the start."

[They all laugh]
Vi (Serious):

"The Council's approved aid for Zaun. Real aid, not just enforcement."

Caitlyn (Adding):

"And they're pardoning the scientists. They'll be able to continue their research safely."

The Future
[Player A Name] (Curious):

"What about you two? What's next?"

Vi (Looking at Caitlyn):

"We keep working. Together. Bridging the gap between our cities."

Caitlyn (Smiling):

"And keeping an eye out for a certain blue-haired girl who might need our help again."

[Player B Name] (Thoughtful):

"You think she'll really come back?"

Vi (Confident):

"She will. When she's ready. And when she does..."

[Vi looks at her Atlas Gauntlets, now powered down]
Vi (Continued):

"We'll be ready too. To help her, not fight her."

Final Words
Caitlyn (To players):

"You should be proud. You helped save lives today."

Vi (Grateful):

"And maybe... maybe you helped save my sister too. Even if it doesn't feel like it yet."

[Player A Name] (Determined):

"If you ever need us again..."

[Player B Name] (Finishing):

"Just light a flare. We'll find you."

[Vi smiles, pulling out the old flare she gave Powder years ago]
Vi (Emotional):

"I'll remember that. Thank you. Both of you."

Caitlyn (Final toast):

"To bridges built and walls torn down."

All Together:

"To Piltover and Zaun."

Narrator (Caitlyn's Voice):

"The truth has a way of finding the light, even in the darkest corners of our cities."

Narrator (Vi's Voice):

"Sometimes the hardest battles aren't against our enemies, but against the lies we tell ourselves."

Narrator (Both):

"But with courage, cooperation, and trust in each other, even the deepest wounds can begin to heal."
