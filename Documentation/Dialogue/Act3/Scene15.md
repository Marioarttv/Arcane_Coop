Return to the Past
Vi (Stopping at entrance):

"This is it. Where everything went wrong seven years ago."

Caitlyn (Placing hand on Vi's shoulder):

"Are you sure you're ready for this?"

Vi (Steeling herself):

"I have to be. For Powder."

[Player A Name] (Looking around):

"The place looks different. More run down, but... there are lights inside."

[Player B Name] (Noticing):

"Fresh shimmer tracks everywhere. Multiple sets. Jinx has been here a lot."

Voices Inside
[They creep closer, hearing voices through broken windows]
Jinx's Voice (Muffled but audible):

"It's ready, Silco! The weapon that'll make them pay for what they did to Vander!"

Silco's Voice (Calm):

"Excellent work, Jinx. With the scientists' cooperation, we finally have all the pieces."

Vi (Whispering, shocked):

"Scientists' cooperation? But she thinks they're dead..."

Caitlyn (Whispering):

"Listen..."

The Fatal Slip
Jinx's Voice (Confused):

"Cooperation? But... you said they fled. You said they were gone."

Silco's Voice (Trying to recover):

"I meant their notes, their research—"

Jinx's Voice (Rising):

"You said they DISAPPEARED. That they were too scared to face justice. But cooperation means... where are they, Silco? WHERE ARE THEY?"

[Player A Name] (Whispering):

"She's figuring it out."

[Player B Name] (Urgent):

"We need to get in there."

Entering the Warehouse
[Vi kicks open the door]
Vi (Loud):

"Powder!"

[Inside: Jinx spins around, weapon in hand. Silco stands near a table covered in papers]
Jinx (Shocked, then angry):

"Vi?! What are you doing here? And with... with THEM?"

[Gestures at Caitlyn and the players]
Silco (Composed but tense):

"Well. The prodigal sister returns."

The Standoff
Caitlyn (Weapon raised):

"Put the weapon down, Jinx."

Jinx (Laughing manically):

"Jinx? JINX?! Even you're calling me that now, Vi?"

Vi (Desperate):

"Powder, please. You need to listen—"

Jinx (Screaming):

"DON'T call me that! Powder's DEAD! You left her to die!"

Vi (Pleading):

"I didn't leave you! I was taken! Marcus arrested me that night!"

The Truth Begins
Jinx (Faltering):

"No... no, you abandoned me. You said I was a jinx and you LEFT!"

Silco (Interjecting):

"Jinx, don't listen to her. She's trying to confuse you—"

[Player A Name] (Stepping forward):

"We have proof! Evidence about what really happened that night!"

[Player B Name] (Supporting):

"About the warehouse, about the explosion. The real truth."

Jinx (Conflicted):

"Shut up! SHUT UP! Silco told me the truth! The scientists stored Hextech cores! They killed Vander!"

Setting Up the Revelation
Vi (Firm):

"That's a lie, Powder. And we can prove it."

Caitlyn (To players):

"Show her. Show her everything we found."

[Player A Name] (Determined):

"We've collected evidence from all over the city."

[Player B Name] (Ready):

"Police reports, witness accounts, scientific records."

Jinx (Wavering):

"I don't... I don't want to hear this..."

Vi (Gentle but urgent):

"You need to. Please, Powder. Just look at the evidence."
