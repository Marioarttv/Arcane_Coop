Scene ID: radio_decoded
Layout: Dual Characters
Theme: Piltover
Message Decoded
[Player B Name] (Shocked):

"Werner's workshop on Fifth Street... an explosion..."

[Player A Name] (Worried):

"And Dr. Renni Stiltner failed to report for protective custody. They knew these people were in danger!"

Caitlyn (Angry):

"Protective custody? Stanton knew about this threat and didn't warn anyone?"

Vi (Serious):

"Worse. He's actively avoiding the warehouse district tonight for 'evidence disposal.' He's cleaning up Marcus's mess."

[Player B Name] (Worried):

"So Werner's already been hit. That means..."

Vi (Urgent):

"Jinx already got to him. She's hunting them down one by one."

Caitlyn (Determined):

"But Renni's still out there. She didn't trust Stanton's protection - smart woman."

[Player A Name] (Thinking):

"If she's hiding on her own, she'd go somewhere she knows. Somewhere safe."

Vi (Realizing):

"Her home. Or someone she trusts. We need to find her before Jinx does."

Planning Next Move
Caitlyn (Checking records):

"According to this, Renni has an apartment above a chem-tech repair shop in Zaun. And... she has a sister. Kira."

[Player B Name] (Recognizing):

"I know that area. It's not far from where I live. Rough neighborhood though."

Vi (Determined):

"Then that's where we go. Maybe the sister knows something."

[Player A Name] (Worried):

"What if Jinx is already there?"

Vi (Serious):

"Then we better hurry. Powder... Jinx... she won't hesitate. Not anymore."

Caitlyn (Gathering equipment):

"We should prepare for trouble. Stanton's enforcers might be watching, and if Jinx shows up..."

[Player B Name] (Determined):

"I can get us there through the back alleys. Avoid enforcer patrols."

[Player A Name] (Ready):

"And I'll keep monitoring the radio. Any more chatter about attacks, we'll know."

Vi (Emotional):

"Renni might be our only chance to understand what Silco's told Jinx. What lies he's fed her about that night."

Caitlyn (Supportive):

"We'll find her, Vi. And we'll find the truth."

Vi (Determined):

"Let's move. Every second we waste is another second Jinx gets closer."
