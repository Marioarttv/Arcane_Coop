Act 1: Complete Dialogue Script
Scene 1: Council Chamber Antechamber
Scene ID: council_antechamber
Layout: Dual Characters
Theme: Piltover
Opening Scene
Vi (Angry):

"A blockade. A bloody BLOCKADE! While Silco sits comfortable and Jinx... Powder is out there with him."

Caitlyn (Worried):

"Vi, the Council needs time to—"

Vi (Angry):

"Time? How much more time do they need? Every second we waste, she slips further away!"

Player Introduction
[Player A Name] (Worried):

"Caitlyn! Thank the gears I found you. I know you're not supposed to be on active cases, but... this couldn't wait."

Caitlyn (Surprised):

"What is it? If Stanton finds out you're—"

[Player A Name] (Determined):

"It's about the blue-haired girl. Someone down in Zaun claims they saw her. Recently. Like, yesterday recently."

Vi (Surprised):

"Who? Who saw her?"

[Player A Name] (Worried):

"That's the thing... they'll only talk to someone they trust. Said they knew you from before, Vi. Goes by the name [Player B Name]."

[Player B Name] (Default):

"Still grabbing people when you're excited, eh Vi?"

Vi (Surprised):

"No way... is that really you? I thought you were—"

[Player B Name] (Worried):

"Dead? Locked up? Nah, just keeping my head down since... since that night. But when I saw what I saw, I knew I had to find you."

Caitlyn (Surprised):

"How did you two even connect?"

[Player A Name] (Default):

"Pure chance. I was following up on witness reports near the docks when they approached ME. Said they had information but would only share it with Vi present."

[Player B Name] (Serious):

"And I wasn't about to trust some random enforcer with this. But when [Player A Name] mentioned working with you, Caitlyn, and that Vi was actually alive and out of Stillwater... I took the risk."

Vi (Worried):

"You really saw her? Powder?"

[Player B Name] (Worried):

"Not here. Too many ears. But yeah, Vi. I saw her. And there's more - something about files with red marks, people being hunted. It's all connected to that night at the warehouse."

Caitlyn (Serious):

"Do you trust them?"

[Player A Name] (Determined):

"They knew things... details about Vi that checked out. And they seemed genuinely scared about what they'd seen."

Vi (Determined):

"Forget the Council and their blockade. This is our lead. We do this together. All four of us."

Caitlyn (Worried):

"We'll need to be careful. If Stanton finds out we're investigating without authorization... he's been paranoid since taking over from Marcus."

[Player B Name] (Serious):

"Then we better not let him find out. Come on, there was a break-in last night. That's where this all starts. Someone dropped something that'll interest you."

Vi (Determined):

"Then what are we waiting for?"


Scene 2: The Crime Scene
Scene ID: crime_scene_zaun
Layout: Dual Characters
Theme: Zaun
Location: Dark alleyway in Zaun
Investigation Begins
[Player B Name] (Serious):

"This is it. Saw the whole thing from my window last night - explosion around 2 AM, then someone bolting from that door."

Vi (Angry):

"These burn patterns... definitely Jinx's work. She always did like her powder bombs."

Caitlyn (Serious):

"Forced entry, but sophisticated. She picked the lock first, then blew it when that didn't work fast enough. She was looking for something specific."

[Player A Name] (Worried):

"This was a records storage facility. Why would she—"

Vi (Serious):

"Because she's not random anymore. Silco's turned her into his weapon. Everything has a purpose now, even if it's twisted."

The Discovery
[Player B Name] (Surprised):

"Guys... there's something over here."
[Picks up files with photos marked with red X's]
"These files... they've got photos. Four people, all marked with red crosses. And look at this stamp - 'PROJECT SAFEGUARD - CLASSIFIED'."

Caitlyn (Serious):

"Let me see those. These are personnel files, but old ones. These scientists worked on early Hextech prototypes before Jayce's breakthrough."

Vi (Worried):

"Why would Powder care about old scientists?"

[Player A Name] (Serious):

"Maybe she doesn't. Maybe Silco does."

Stanton's Interruption
[Sound of enforcer boots approaching]
Deputy Stanton (Angry):

"Well, well. Kiramman. I should have known you'd show up where you don't belong."

Caitlyn (Determined):

"Deputy Stanton. We're investigating—"

Stanton (Angry):

"You're interfering with an active crime scene is what you're doing."
[Spots the files]
"Those files... where did you get those?"

[Player B Name] (Worried):

"They were on the ground. The suspect must have dropped—"

Stanton (Surprised then Angry):

"These are... these were in Marcus's private— I mean, these are classified enforcer documents!"

Vi (Serious):

"Marcus's private files? How would Jinx know about those?"

Stanton (Angry):

"That's none of your concern! This is evidence in an ongoing investigation. Way above your clearance, Kiramman."

Caitlyn (Determined):

"Deputy, if this is connected to the attacks—"

Stanton (Angry):

"The only thing connected here is you to a violation of protocol! Get out of here before I report this to the Council. Sheriff Marcus may have tolerated your meddling, but I won't."

[Player A Name] (whispering):

"He's sweating. He knows something."

Stanton (Angry):

"What was that, recruit? You want to join your friend in Stillwater?"
[To Vi]
"Oh yes, I know all about you. One word from me and you're back in that cell."

Vi (Angry):

"Try it."

Caitlyn (Worried):

"Vi, don't. We're leaving."
[To Stanton]
"This isn't over, Deputy."

Stanton (Angry):

"It is if you know what's good for you. Now GET OUT!"

After Leaving
Vi (Serious):

"He's dirty. Did you see his face when he mentioned Marcus's files?"

Caitlyn (Serious):

"Those weren't just classified documents. They were personal files Marcus kept hidden. But how did Jinx know they existed?"

[Player B Name] (Worried):

"And why these four scientists specifically? What connects them?"

[Player A Name] (Determined):

"We need to find out who those people in the photos were. If Jinx marked them..."

Vi (Serious):

"Then they're either already dead, or about to be. We need to move fast."

Caitlyn (Determined):

"The enforcer database. I can get us in, but we'll have to be careful. Stanton will be watching for us now."

[Player B Name] (Worried):

"The Piltover Enforcer HQ? You sure about this?"

Vi (Determined):

"No choice. Those people don't know what's coming for them. And neither does Powder if Silco's pulling her strings."

Caitlyn (Serious):

"We'll split up once we're inside. [Player B Name], you'll need to describe what you remember from those photos to [Player A Name], who can search the database."

[Player B Name] (Determined):

"I got a good look at them. I can do this."

[Player A Name] (Determined):

"And I know my way around the enforcer systems. We'll find them."

Vi (Serious):

"Then let's go. Every second counts."
