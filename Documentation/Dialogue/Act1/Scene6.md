Post-Code Cracker Dialogue
Scene 6: After Decoding the Message
Scene ID: code_decoded
Layout: Dual Characters
Theme: Zaun
Message Revealed
[Player A Name] (Reading):

"SHIMMER... FACTORY... LEVEL... THREE. That's the message!"

[Player B Name] (Recognizing):

"The old shimmer refinement facility? That place has been abandoned for years!"

Kira (Confused):

"Why would she go there?"

Vi (Realizing):

"She wasn't leaving you a hideout location..."

Caitlyn (Understanding):

"She was telling you where she was going. She went to investigate."

Kira (Shocked):

"Wait, that's... she wouldn't. That message wasn't FOR me to follow. It's where she was heading!"

[Player A Name] (Worried):

"You think she went to rescue the other scientists?"

Kira (Breaking down):

"She figured out where the others were taken and she... oh no, Renni, you brave fool."

Vi (Urgent):

"She went alone? When?"

Kira (Calculating):

"The note appeared yesterday morning, so... she's been gone at least a day."

The Explosion
[A distant explosion rattles the windows. Orange glow on the horizon]
[Player B Name] (Alarmed):

"What was that?!"

[Player A's radio crackles to life]
Radio:

"Explosion at old Shimmer refinement facility, level three. Blue-haired suspect seen entering..."

Vi (Horrified):

"Jinx. She's there!"

Caitlyn (Urgent):

"If Renni's there too..."

Vi (Already moving):

"We go. NOW!"

Kira (Desperate):

"Wait! Take me with you!"

Caitlyn (Firm but gentle):

"No. It's too dangerous. Stay here, lock the doors."

[Player A Name] (To Kira):

"We'll find her. We'll bring her back."

Kira (Tearful):

"Please... save her. Please."

Racing to the Factory
[Player B Name] (Running):

"The factory's not far! I know a shortcut through the old industrial district!"

Vi (Determined):

"Jinx is there. After all this time... she's right there."

Caitlyn (Warning):

"Vi, remember - she's not the Powder you knew. She's dangerous now."

Vi (Emotional):

"I know. But she's still my sister. I have to try."

[Player A Name] (Worried):

"What if the scientists are already...?"

Vi (Fierce):

"They're not. They can't be. Silco needs them alive for something."

[Player B Name] (Pointing ahead):

"There! The factory! I can see smoke!"

Caitlyn (Strategic):

"We need to be smart about this. If Jinx set off explosions, the place could be unstable."

Vi (Desperate):

"I don't care. Renni might be in there. The other scientists too. And Jinx..."
