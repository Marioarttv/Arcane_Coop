Scene ID: database_revelation
Layout: Dual Characters
Theme: Piltover
Location: Piltover Enforcer HQ Records Room
Discovery Complete
[Player A Name] (Surprised):

"Got them all. Four matches in the system... but this doesn't make sense."

Caitlyn (Worried):

"What do you mean? Who are they?"

[Player A Name] (Reading from screen):

"Dr. Werner Steinberg, Dr. Renni Stiltner, Professor Albus Ferros, and Dr. Corin Reveck. All of them worked on something called... Project Safeguard?"

Vi (Confused):

"Never heard of it. What's Project Safeguard?"

Caitlyn (Surprised):

"Wait... I recognize these names. My mother mentioned them once at a Council dinner. They're all former apprentices of Heimerdinger."

[Player B Name] (Worried):

"Heimerdinger? The Council guy with the fur?"

Caitlyn (Serious):

"These aren't random targets... they all worked on early Hextech prototypes before the technology was regulated. Before Jayce's breakthrough."

Vi (Angry):

"But why would Powder... why would Jinx care about old scientists?"

[Player A Name] (Serious):

"Look at this - their project was shut down seven years ago. Right around the time of..."

Vi (Realizing):

"The warehouse. The night Vander died."

The Revelation
Caitlyn (Reading):

"According to these records, Project Safeguard was an attempt to create stable Hextech cores for industrial use. But it was deemed too dangerous and shut down."

[Player B Name] (Confused):

"So what, Jinx thinks these people had something to do with that night?"

Vi (Angry):

"That's impossible. The explosion was... it was Powder's bomb. The hex crystals she put in it."

Caitlyn (Worried):

"Vi... what if someone told her otherwise? What if someone made her believe—"

Vi (Shocked):

"Silco. That bastard. He's been lying to her."

Radio Interruption
[The enforcer radio Player A grabbed earlier suddenly crackles to life]
Radio Static:

"...incident at... street... blue hair seen fleeing..."

[Player A Name] (Surprised):

"The radio! It's picking up enforcer chatter!"

Caitlyn (Urgent):

"Quick, we need to hear this. But the signal's breaking up."

[Player B Name] (Confused):

"I can barely make it out. Something about an explosion?"

Vi (Determined):

"We need to decode this. If it's about Jinx, we need to know what happened."

Setting Up Signal Decoder
[Player A Name] (Focused):

"The audio's fragmented but I can hear pieces. If we had the written patrol logs..."

[Player B Name] (Realizing):

"Wait! I saw a dispatch terminal over there. It shows transcripts but with missing words - probably corrupted data."

Caitlyn (Determined):

"Perfect. [Player A Name], you listen to the audio transmission. [Player B Name], you read what's on the transcript."

Vi (Urgent):

"Work together - fill in the gaps. We need to know what's happening out there."

[Player A Name] (Ready):

"I'm getting clearer audio now. Ready when you are."

[Player B Name] (Ready):

"Transcript's up. There are blanks everywhere but I can see the structure."

Vi (Worried):

"Whatever you're about to hear... it might tell us where these scientists are. Or if we're already too late."

Caitlyn (Serious):

"Focus on any mention of locations, names, or Deputy Stanton. He's covering something up and we need to know what."
