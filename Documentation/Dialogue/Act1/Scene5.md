Scene ID: renni_apartment
Layout: Dual Characters
Theme: Zaun
Location: Above a chem-tech repair shop, Zaun
Arrival
[Player B Name] (Worried):

"This is it. Kepler's Chem-Tech Repairs. Renni lives in the apartment above."	

Vi (Looking around):

"Place looks abandoned. Shop's been closed for days by the look of it."

Caitlyn (Serious):

"The lock's been forced. Recently. Someone's been here."

[Player A Name] (Worried):

"You think it was Jinx?"

Vi (Determined):

"Only one way to find out."

[They climb the stairs to the apartment. Vi knocks firmly]
Vi (Calling out):

"Hello? Anyone home? We're looking for Renni Stiltner!"

[Footsteps inside. A young woman opens the door - eyes red from crying]
Meeting Kira
Kira (Suspicious):

"Who are you? What do you want?"

Caitlyn (Showing badge discretely):

"I'm Caitlyn Kiramman. We're here about your sister."

Kira (Bitter):

"You're too late. She's gone. Left three days ago after someone torched her workshop."

Vi (Urgent):

"Three days? Where did she go?"

Kira (Angry):

"If I knew that, would I be standing here? First Werner gets attacked, then the enforcers show up offering 'protection,' and Renni just... vanishes."

[Player B Name] (Sympathetic):

"You didn't trust the enforcers either."

Kira (Scoffing):

"Trust them? Deputy Stanton couldn't even look me in the eye. Kept talking about 'containing the situation.' Renni was right not to go with them."

The Discovery
[Player A Name] (Gentle):

"We're trying to help. We think your sister might be in danger."

Kira (Breaking down):

"In danger? She's probably already dead! Just like Werner, just like the others!"

Vi (Firm but kind):

"Hey. Look at me. We're not with Stanton. We're trying to stop whoever's hunting them."

Kira (Studying Vi):

"You're from down here. I can tell. Why do you care?"

Vi (Emotional):

"Because the person doing this... she's my sister. And I need to stop her before she does something she can't take back."

Kira (Shocked, then sympathetic):

"Your sister? I... I'm sorry."

Caitlyn (Urgent):

"Kira, did Renni leave anything? Any clue about where she might go?"

Kira (Remembering):

"She... wait. She was paranoid, but smart. Said if anything happened, she'd leave me a way to find her."

[Kira retrieves a crumpled paper from a drawer]
Kira (Handing paper to Player B):

"Found this under my door yesterday. Just looks like her old study notes - definitions, word games we used to play as kids. Made no sense to me."

Discovering the Wall
[Player B Name] (Looking at paper):

"These are... definitions? Synonyms? Like a vocabulary test?"

Kira (Frustrated):

"That's what I thought! But why would she—"

[Player A Name] (Calling from other room):

"Guys! You need to see this!"

[They rush to Renni's bedroom]
Caitlyn (Surprised):

"The wall... it's covered in graffiti."

Vi (Recognizing):

"Not graffiti. It's a message. Look - words with missing letters."

[Player A Name] (Realizing):

"The words on the wall have blanks..."

[Player B Name] (Connecting):

"And this paper has definitions! She left us a code!"

Vi (Impressed):

"Classic Renni. Even her hiding spots have puzzles."

Setting Up Code Cracker
Kira (Hopeful):

"You can solve it? You can find her?"

Caitlyn (Determined):

"We'll figure it out. [Player B Name], you have the definitions. [Player A Name], you can see the wall clearly."

[Player B Name] (Ready):

"I'll read out the definitions and synonyms."

[Player A Name] (Ready):

"And I'll match them to the words on the wall, fill in the blanks."

Vi (Serious):

"Work fast. If Renni went to all this trouble, it means she knew someone would come looking."

Kira (Worried):

"Please... just find her. She's all I have left."

Caitlyn (Reassuring):

"We will. I promise."
