## Map Visual Design (Piltover Player View)

### Map Layout Concept:
```
[START: Sewer Entrance]
        |
        ↓ (FORWARD)
[Industrial Pipes]
        |
        ↓ (AROUND right)
[Chemical Plant]
        |
        ↓ (BESIDE tank)
[Underground Market]
        |
        ↓ (ACROSS bridge)
[PILTOVER BRIDGE - VICTORY!]
```

### Visual Map Elements:
- **Red Path**: Bright red line showing the correct route
- **Location Icons**: Distinctive symbols for each area (pipe, chemical flask, market stall, bridge)
- **Wrong Path Indicators**: Faded gray paths showing wrong choices
- **Current Location**: Glowing golden indicator (Piltover styling)
- **Preposition Labels**: Clear text labels on map showing spatial relationships

## Educational Value

### Vocabulary Progression:
1. **Basic Directions**: left, right, forward, straight
2. **Simple Prepositions**: through, under, around
