# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an **ASP.NET Core Blazor Server** application for an Arcane-themed cooperative escape room experience. The application uses .NET 9.0 and implements a dual-city theme with Zaun vs Piltover.

## Development Commands

### Running the Application
```bash
dotnet run
```
The application runs on:
- HTTP: http://localhost:5055
- HTTPS: https://localhost:7104

### Build Commands
```bash
dotnet build
dotnet clean
dotnet restore
```

### Publishing
```bash
dotnet publish -c Release
```

## Architecture

### Project Structure
- **Program.cs**: Main entry point with minimal API setup
- **Components/**: Contains all Razor components
  - **App.razor**: Root component with HTML document structure
  - **Routes.razor**: Router configuration
  - **_Imports.razor**: Global using statements
  - **Layout/MainLayout.razor**: Base layout component
  - **Pages/**: Page components
    - **LandingPage.razor**: Main game selection page with extensive CSS styling
    - **Error.razor**: Standard error page

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: ASP.NET Core 9.0 with Blazor Server
- **Rendering**: Interactive Server Components
- **Styling**: Component-scoped CSS with extensive custom styling
- **Fonts**: Custom "Arcane Nine" font and Google Fonts (Orbitron, Cinzel, Rajdhani)

### Key Features
- **Dual-theme design** with Zaun (underground/cyberpunk) and Piltover (steampunk/golden) aesthetics
- **Character selection system** with Vi, Caitlyn, Jayce, and Viktor
- **Responsive design** with mobile-first approach
- **Interactive UI elements** with hover effects and animations
- **Audio controls** system (placeholder implementation)

### Development Patterns
- Uses **minimal APIs** for simple setup
- **Component-scoped CSS** with extensive styling (1000+ lines in LandingPage)
- **Enum-based** city selection (City.Zaun, City.Piltover)
- **Async/await** patterns for component interactions
- **Cascading parameters** for context sharing

### Static Assets
- Located in **wwwroot/**
- Character images: Vi.jpeg, Cait.jpeg, Jayce.jpeg, Viktor.jpeg
- Custom font: Arcane Nine.otf
- Component-specific CSS files generated by build process

### Configuration
- Standard ASP.NET Core configuration in **appsettings.json**
- Development/Production environment support
- HTTPS redirection and HSTS enabled for production

## Important Notes

- This is a **game/entertainment application** focused on the Arcane universe
- The project emphasizes **visual design** with extensive CSS animations and effects
- **Character selection logic is not yet implemented** (see TODO comments in LandingPage.razor:1069)
- **Audio system is placeholder** functionality
- Uses **Blazor Server** rendering mode throughout
