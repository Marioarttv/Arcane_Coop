# Rune Protocol Synchronizer: Advanced 2-Player Logic Puzzles

## Overview

The **Rune Protocol Synchronizer** is a sophisticated cooperative logic puzzle system built into the Arcane Coop escape room experience. Two players must work together to synchronize mystical runes by satisfying complex conditional rules, with each player controlling different runes and seeing different rule sets.

## Game Mechanics

### Core Concept
- **8 Runes Total**: R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8 (each can be ON or OFF)
- **Player A (Piltover/Caitlyn)**: Controls R1-R4, sees Alpha Protocol Rules
- **Player B (Zaunite/Vi)**: Controls R5-R8, sees Beta Protocol Rules  
- **Cooperative Goal**: All rules for both players must be satisfied simultaneously
- **Rule-Based Victory**: Win condition is triggered when ALL rules for both players are satisfied simultaneously (may have multiple valid solutions)

### Gameplay Flow
1. Players join the same room and start the protocol
2. Each player sees their specific rules and can only toggle their assigned runes
3. Real-time validation shows which rules are satisfied (âœ“) or violated (âœ—)
4. Players must communicate and coordinate to find the unique solution
5. Success unlocks the next level with increased complexity

## Level 1: Logic Gateway Protocol - Alpha

### Rules Summary
**Player A (Alpha/Piltover) Rules:**
- A1: Exactly three of your runes (R1-R4) must be active
- A2: IF R5 is active, THEN R1 must be inactive  
- A3: IF R7 is inactive, THEN R2 and R4 must be in the same state

**Player B (Beta/Zaunite) Rules:**
- B1: Exactly one of your runes (R5-R8) must be active
- B2: Either R5 or R7 must be active (but not both)
- B3: IF R1 is inactive, THEN R5 must be active

### Solution Path (Level 1)
The logical deduction chain:

1. **From B1 & B2**: Only one Beta rune can be UP, and it must be either R5 or R7
2. **Testing R7=UP**: This would mean R5=DOWN, but then B3 requires R5=UP if R1=DOWN, creating contradiction
3. **Therefore R5=UP**: This is the only Beta rune that can be active
4. **From A2**: Since R5=UP, R1 must be DOWN  
5. **From B3**: Since R1=DOWN, R5 must be UP (âœ“ consistent)
6. **From A1**: Need exactly 3 Alpha runes UP, but R1=DOWN, so R2, R3, R4 must all be UP
7. **From A3**: R7=DOWN (since R5=UP and B2), so R2 and R4 must match (both UP âœ“)

**Primary Solution**: R1=DOWN, R2=UP, R3=UP, R4=UP, R5=UP, R6=DOWN, R7=DOWN, R8=DOWN

**Note**: The system now accepts any configuration where all rules are satisfied, not just this specific solution. There may be additional valid combinations!

### Key Insight
R5 being UP is the critical insight that unlocks the entire logical chain. This forces specific states for other runes through the conditional dependencies.

## Level 2: Logic Gateway Protocol - Beta

### Rules Summary  
**Player A (Alpha/Piltover) Rules:**
- A1: IF R5 and R6 are different positions, THEN R1 must equal R7
- A2: IF R3 is active, THEN exactly 5 total runes must be active
- A3: Alpha UP count must equal Beta DOWN count

**Player B (Beta/Zaunite) Rules:**
- B1: IF R1 equals R4, THEN R6 must be active
- B2: IF R8 is inactive, THEN R2 and R3 must be different  
- B3: Either R5 is active OR (R7 is inactive AND R4 is active)

### Solution Path (Level 2)
The advanced deduction requires finding contradictions:

1. **From A3**: Alpha UP count = Beta DOWN count
   - If Alpha has X UP, then Alpha has (4-X) DOWN
   - If Beta has Y UP, then Beta has (4-Y) DOWN  
   - Rule: X = (4-Y), therefore X + Y = 4
   - **Total UP across both players = 4 (always!)**

2. **From A2 Contradiction**: If R3=UP, then exactly 5 total must be UP
   - But A3 proves total must always be 4
   - **Therefore R3 must be DOWN!**

3. **Cascade Effect**: With R3=DOWN established:
   - From B2: If R8=DOWN, then R2â‰ R3, so R2=UP (since R3=DOWN)
   - From B3: Either R5=UP OR (R7=DOWN AND R4=UP) must be true
   - From A3: Need Alpha UP = Beta DOWN = 2 (since total UP = 4)

4. **Final Deduction**: Working through the constraints:
   - R2=UP, R3=DOWN (established above)
   - Need 2 total Alpha UP: R2=UP, so need 1 more from {R1,R4}
   - Need 2 total Beta UP to satisfy A3
   - B3 forces either R5=UP or both (R7=DOWN AND R4=UP)

**Unique Solution**: R1=DOWN, R2=UP, R3=DOWN, R4=UP, R5=UP, R6=UP, R7=DOWN, R8=DOWN

### Key Insight  
The "impossible 5-UP requirement" is the critical contradiction that forces R3=DOWN, creating a cascade of logical deductions. Players must recognize that some rule combinations create impossible situations.

## Technical Infrastructure

### Backend Architecture

#### Data Models (`Models/RuneProtocolModels.cs`)
```csharp
public class RuneProtocolLevel
{
    public LogicRule[] AlphaRules { get; set; }  // Player A rules
    public LogicRule[] BetaRules { get; set; }   // Player B rules  
    public bool[] Solution { get; set; }         // The unique answer
    public string SolutionExplanation { get; set; }
}

public class LogicRule
{
    public RuleType Type { get; set; }           // COUNT_EXACT, CONDITIONAL_IF, etc.
    public string Description { get; set; }     // Human-readable rule
    public int[] InvolvedRunes { get; set; }     // Which runes this rule affects
    public bool IsValidated { get; set; }       // Current satisfaction status
}

public enum RuleType
{
    COUNT_EXACT,    // "Exactly N runes must be UP"  
    CONDITIONAL_IF, // "IF condition THEN consequence"
    EITHER_OR,      // "Either A or B (but not both)"
    SAME_STATE,     // "Multiple runes must match"
}
```

#### Victory Condition Logic
```csharp
// Check if puzzle is solved by validating all rules are satisfied
var (alphaSatisfied, alphaTotal, _) = ValidatePlayerRules(PlayerRole.Piltover);
var (betaSatisfied, betaTotal, _) = ValidatePlayerRules(PlayerRole.Zaunite);

var allRulesSatisfied = (alphaSatisfied == alphaTotal) && (betaSatisfied == betaTotal);

if (allRulesSatisfied)
{
    IsCompleted = true;
    return "ðŸŽ‰ PUZZLE SOLVED! All rules satisfied!";
}
```

    var rule = playerView.Rules[i];
    var isValidated = playerView.RuleValidationMessages[i].StartsWith("âœ“");
    
    <div class="rule-item @(isValidated ? "validated" : "pending")">
        <div class="rule-description">@rule.Description</div>
        <div class="rule-feedback">@validationMessage</div>

### Advanced Rule Validation Engine

The system supports complex logical operations:

```csharp
private RuleValidationResult ValidateSpecialRule(LogicRule rule, bool[] runeStates)
{
    switch (rule.Id)
    {
        case "A2": // IF R3 is active, THEN exactly 5 total must be active
            if (runeStates[2]) // R3 is UP
            {
                var totalUp = runeStates.Count(s => s);
                result.IsValid = totalUp == 5;
                result.Message = result.IsValid 
                    ? "âœ“ R3 is active, and exactly 5 total runes are active"
                    : $"âœ— R3 is active, so exactly 5 total must be active (currently {totalUp})";
            }
            break;
            
        case "B3": // Either R5 is active OR (R7 is inactive AND R4 is active)
            var condition1 = runeStates[4]; // R5 UP
            var condition2 = !runeStates[6] && runeStates[3]; // R7 DOWN AND R4 UP
            result.IsValid = condition1 || condition2;
            break;
    }
}
```

## Expansion System

### Adding New Levels
The architecture supports unlimited expansion through the `LevelBank` array:

```csharp
private static readonly RuneProtocolLevel[] LevelBank = new[]
{
    // Level 1: Basic conditional logic
    new RuneProtocolLevel { /* Level 1 definition */ },
    
    // Level 2: Advanced interdependent rules  
    new RuneProtocolLevel { /* Level 2 definition */ },
    
    // Level 3: Add new challenges here
    new RuneProtocolLevel
    {
        LevelNumber = 3,
        Title = "Logic Gateway Protocol - Gamma",
        AlphaRules = new[] { /* New rule types */ },
        BetaRules = new[] { /* Complex combinations */ },
        Solution = new[] { /* Unique solution */ }
    }
};
```
