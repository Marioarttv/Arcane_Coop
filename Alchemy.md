## Game Mechanics

### Drag-and-Drop System

The core interaction system uses the **blazor-dragdrop** library to provide smooth, intuitive ingredient manipulation:

#### **Ingredient Pool**
- **Layout**: Centralized grid displaying all available ingredients
- **Dynamic Content**: Pool updates as ingredients are combined and processed
- **Visual States**: Color-coded borders indicating processing state
  - Blue: Raw ingredients
  - Yellow: Ground ingredients
  - Red: Heated ingredients  
  - Green: Chopped ingredients
  - **Purple: Mixed ingredients (from combination)**
- **True Movement**: Ingredients move between pool and stations (no duplication)
- **Smart Updates**: Pool syncs with server state via SignalR events

#### **Processing Stations**
Four specialized stations arranged horizontally for maximum efficiency:

1. **‚öóÔ∏è Mixing Station (NEW!)**
   - **Function**: Combines 2 specific ingredients into new compounds
   - **Capacity**: Exactly 2 ingredients (Shimmer Crystal + Hex Berries)
   - **Output**: Creates Shimmer Essence (consumes original ingredients)
   - **Visual**: Purple alchemical flask with magical gradient
   - **Unique Feature**: Only station that creates entirely new ingredients

2. **ü•£ Mortar & Pestle Station**
   - **Function**: Grinds ingredients into powder
   - **Output State**: Ground
   - **Visual**: Traditional mortar and pestle icon with earthy colors

3. **üî• Heating Station**
   - **Function**: Applies heat to extract/stabilize essences
   - **Output State**: Heated
   - **Visual**: Flame icon with warm color palette
   - **Enhanced Role**: Now used to stabilize combined ingredients

4. **üî™ Cutting Board Station**
   - **Function**: Precisely chops ingredients
   - **Output State**: Chopped
   - **Visual**: Knife icon with sharp, clean aesthetics

**Station Workflow**:
1. Drag ingredient from pool to station
2. Process button appears automatically
3. Click process button to transform ingredient
4. Processed ingredient returns to pool with new state

#### **Brewing Cauldron**
- **Capacity**: Maximum 3 ingredients
- **Validation**: Only accepts processed ingredients (rejects raw ingredients)
- **Visual Feedback**: Golden drop zone with hover effects
- **Submission**: "Brew Potion" button appears when ingredients are added

### Recipe Solution

**Vi's Healing Potion** now requires a complex 4-step process with ingredient combination:

#### **Step 1: Magical Combination**
- **Ingredients**: Shimmer Crystal + Hex Berries
- **Station**: ‚öóÔ∏è Mixing Station (NEW!)
- **Action**: Drag both ingredients to mixing station ‚Üí Click "‚ú® Combine"
- **Result**: Creates **Shimmer Essence** (Mixed state)

#### **Step 2: Essence Stabilization**
- **Ingredient**: Shimmer Essence (from Step 1)
- **Station**: üî• Heating Station
- **Action**: Heat the volatile essence to stabilize it
- **Result**: **Heated Shimmer Essence**

#### **Step 3: Mushroom Preparation**
- **Ingredient**: Zaun Grey Mushroom
- **Station**: üî™ Cutting Board
- **Action**: Precisely chop into uniform pieces
- **Result**: **Chopped Zaun Grey**

#### **Step 4: Final Brewing**
- **Cauldron Contents** (in order):
  1. Heated Shimmer Essence
  2. Chopped Zaun Grey  
  3. Vial of Tears (Raw - acts as catalyst)
- **Action**: Click "‚ú® Brew Potion"

**Success Criteria**:
- Must complete combination step first (2 ingredients ‚Üí 1 combined ingredient)
- Combined ingredient must be further processed (heated)
- All 3 final ingredients must be added to cauldron in correct order
- Server validates the complete 4-step process

## Technical Implementation

### Blazor-DragDrop Library Integration

#### **Key Components Used**

```razor
<Dropzone Items="@ingredientList" 
          Class="custom-dropzone"
          MaxItems="1"
          OnItemDrop="@((AlchemyIngredient item) => HandleDrop(item))"
          Accepts="@((ingredient, targetZone) => ValidateDropCondition(ingredient))">
    <!-- Drop zone content -->
</Dropzone>
```

#### **Critical Implementation Insights**

1. **EventCallback Signatures**
   - Must use strongly-typed EventCallback parameters
   - Incorrect: `OnItemDrop="@HandleDrop"`
   - Correct: `OnItemDrop="@((AlchemyIngredient item) => HandleDrop(item))"`

2. **State Management**
   - `StateHasChanged()` must be called after drop events to update UI
   - Separate collections needed for each dropzone (processing stations, cauldron)
   - Server-side state synchronization via SignalR for multiplayer consistency

3. **Visual Feedback**
   - CSS classes automatically applied during drag operations:
     - `plk-dd-in-transit`: Applied to dragged items
     - `plk-dd-dragging-over`: Applied to valid drop targets during hover
   - Custom styling can enhance these default behaviors

4. **Validation Logic**
   - `Accepts` parameter controls drop validation
   - Client-side validation for immediate feedback
   - Server-side validation for game integrity

#### **Performance Optimizations**

- **Hardware Acceleration**: CSS transforms use `transform3d()` for smooth animations
- **Efficient Rendering**: `@key` attributes prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Minimal DOM Updates**: Only update affected components on state changes

### SignalR Multiplayer Architecture

```csharp
// Hub Methods
JoinAlchemyGame(string roomId, string playerName)     // Role assignment
ProcessIngredient(string roomId, string ingredientId, string station)  // Transform ingredients
AddToCauldron(string roomId, string ingredientId, int position)        // Cauldron management
SubmitPotion(string roomId)                           // Recipe validation
RestartAlchemyGame(string roomId)                     // Reset game state
```

**Event Flow**:
1. Players join game ‚Üí Role assignment (Piltover/Zaunite)
2. Ingredient processing ‚Üí Server validation ‚Üí State broadcast
3. Cauldron additions ‚Üí Order tracking ‚Üí Progress updates
4. Potion submission ‚Üí Recipe validation ‚Üí Success/failure feedback
