- **Capabilities**:
  - Drag-and-drop ingredient manipulation
  - Access to 3 processing stations (Mortar & Pestle, Heating Station, Cutting Board)
  - Cauldron management with 3-ingredient capacity
  - Real-time feedback on processing actions and mistakes

## Game Mechanics

### Drag-and-Drop System

The core interaction system uses the **blazor-dragdrop** library to provide smooth, intuitive ingredient manipulation:

#### **Ingredient Pool**
- **Layout**: Centralized grid displaying all available ingredients
- **Visual States**: Color-coded borders indicating processing state
  - Blue: Raw ingredients
  - Yellow: Ground ingredients
  - Red: Heated ingredients  
  - Green: Chopped ingredients
- **Interaction**: Ingredients can be dragged to processing stations or (when processed) to the cauldron

#### **Processing Stations**
Three specialized stations for ingredient transformation:

1. **ðŸ¥£ Mortar & Pestle Station**
   - **Function**: Grinds ingredients into powder
   - **Output State**: Ground
   - **Visual**: Traditional mortar and pestle icon with earthy colors

2. **ðŸ”¥ Heating Station**
   - **Function**: Applies heat to extract essences
   - **Output State**: Heated
   - **Visual**: Flame icon with warm color palette

3. **ðŸ”ª Cutting Board Station**
   - **Function**: Precisely chops ingredients
   - **Output State**: Chopped
   - **Visual**: Knife icon with sharp, clean aesthetics

**Station Workflow**:
1. Drag ingredient from pool to station
2. Process button appears automatically
3. Click process button to transform ingredient
4. Processed ingredient returns to pool with new state

#### **Brewing Cauldron**
- **Capacity**: Maximum 3 ingredients
- **Validation**: Only accepts processed ingredients (rejects raw ingredients)
- **Visual Feedback**: Golden drop zone with hover effects
- **Submission**: "Brew Potion" button appears when ingredients are added

### Recipe Solution

**Vi's Healing Potion** requires exactly 3 processed ingredients in the correct order:

1. **Shimmer Crystal** â†’ Ground (using Mortar & Pestle)
2. **Hex Berries** â†’ Heated (using Heating Station)  
3. **Zaun Grey Mushroom** â†’ Chopped (using Cutting Board)

**Success Criteria**:
- All 3 ingredients must be processed correctly
- Ingredients must be added to cauldron in the specified order
- Recipe validation occurs server-side for accuracy

## Technical Implementation

### Blazor-DragDrop Library Integration

#### **Key Components Used**

```razor
<Dropzone Items="@ingredientList" 
          Class="custom-dropzone"
          MaxItems="1"
          OnItemDrop="@((AlchemyIngredient item) => HandleDrop(item))"
          Accepts="@((ingredient, targetZone) => ValidateDropCondition(ingredient))">
    <!-- Drop zone content -->
</Dropzone>
```

#### **Critical Implementation Insights**

1. **EventCallback Signatures**
   - Must use strongly-typed EventCallback parameters
   - Incorrect: `OnItemDrop="@HandleDrop"`
   - Correct: `OnItemDrop="@((AlchemyIngredient item) => HandleDrop(item))"`

2. **State Management**
   - `StateHasChanged()` must be called after drop events to update UI
   - Separate collections needed for each dropzone (processing stations, cauldron)
   - Server-side state synchronization via SignalR for multiplayer consistency

3. **Visual Feedback**
   - CSS classes automatically applied during drag operations:
     - `plk-dd-in-transit`: Applied to dragged items
     - `plk-dd-dragging-over`: Applied to valid drop targets during hover
   - Custom styling can enhance these default behaviors

4. **Validation Logic**
   - `Accepts` parameter controls drop validation
   - Client-side validation for immediate feedback
   - Server-side validation for game integrity

#### **Performance Optimizations**

- **Hardware Acceleration**: CSS transforms use `transform3d()` for smooth animations
- **Efficient Rendering**: `@key` attributes prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Minimal DOM Updates**: Only update affected components on state changes

### SignalR Multiplayer Architecture

```csharp
// Hub Methods
JoinAlchemyGame(string roomId, string playerName)     // Role assignment
ProcessIngredient(string roomId, string ingredientId, string station)  // Transform ingredients
AddToCauldron(string roomId, string ingredientId, int position)        // Cauldron management
SubmitPotion(string roomId)                           // Recipe validation
RestartAlchemyGame(string roomId)                     // Reset game state
```

**Event Flow**:
1. Players join game â†’ Role assignment (Piltover/Zaunite)
2. Ingredient processing â†’ Server validation â†’ State broadcast
3. Cauldron additions â†’ Order tracking â†’ Progress updates
4. Potion submission â†’ Recipe validation â†’ Success/failure feedback
