# Rune Protocol Synchronizer: Conditional Logic Puzzle

## üìñ Overview

The **Rune Protocol Synchronizer** is a sophisticated cooperative conditional logic puzzle that challenges players to coordinate the configuration of 8 magical runes through collaborative constraint satisfaction. Players must work together using different sets of conditional rules to achieve perfect system synchronization.

### üé≠ Narrative Integration

- **Piltover Player (Caitlyn)**: Hextech Protocol Engineer with access to official technical specifications
- **Zaunite Player (Vi)**: Chemtech Systems Analyst with field experience and practical observations
- **Collaborative Challenge**: Each player controls 4 runes and receives different conditional rules, requiring communication and logical reasoning

## üéØ Core Mechanics

### Rune Control System
- **8 Total Runes**: R1 through R8, each with ON/OFF states
- **Split Control**: Piltover controls R1-R4, Zaunite controls R5-R8
- **Real-time Synchronization**: All state changes are instantly shared between players
- **Visual Feedback**: Runes show active/inactive states with themed animations

### Conditional Logic Rules
- **Asymmetric Information**: Each player receives different sets of conditional rules
- **Progressive Complexity**: 4 difficulty levels from basic conditionals to master-level logic
- **Rule Validation**: Real-time feedback on which conditions are satisfied/violated
- **Hint System**: 3-tier progressive hint system for educational support

## üìà Progressive Difficulty System

### Level 1: Emergency Protocol Activation (Tutorial)
**Scenario**: Critical system instability detected. Two engineers must coordinate emergency stabilization.

#### Sample Rules:
**Piltover Rules:**
- Safety Protocol 1.1: If Primary Stabilizer (R1) is active, Backup Dampener (R5) must be offline
- Resonance Prevention 2.3: Power Regulator (R2) and Energy Buffer (R6) cannot operate simultaneously
- Activation Sequence 3.7: When Main Controller (R3) is offline, Emergency Override (R4) must be active

**Zaunite Rules:**
- Observation Log #15: The Blue Catalyst (R7) only stabilizes when Primary Stabilizer (R1) is running
- Warning Report #22: If Red Inhibitor (R8) is active, Power Regulator (R2) will overload
- System Balance #9: Either Energy Buffer (R6) or Blue Catalyst (R7) must be online, never both offline

**Solution**: R1=ON, R2=ON, R3=OFF, R4=ON, R5=OFF, R6=OFF, R7=ON, R8=OFF

### Level 2: Hextech Resonance Stabilization (Intermediate)
**Scenario**: Multiple cascade failures detected requiring advanced coordination.

#### Advanced Logic Patterns:
- Compound conditionals with multiple variables
- Either/OR exclusivity requirements
- Dependency chains between different rune groups
- 2-3 valid solutions encouraging collaborative discussion

**Solution**: R1=OFF, R2=OFF, R3=ON, R4=OFF, R5=ON, R6=ON, R7=ON, R8=OFF

### Level 3: Cascade Prevention Protocol (Advanced)
**Scenario**: Critical cascade failures requiring master-level coordination.

#### Complex Dependencies:
- Multi-step logical chains and nested implications
- Array-based counting requirements (exactly one, exactly two)
- Cross-sector balance requirements
- Unique solution requiring systematic elimination

**Solution**: R1=OFF, R2=ON, R3=OFF, R4=ON, R5=ON, R6=ON, R7=OFF, R8=OFF

### Level 4: Master Synchronization Protocol (Expert)
**Scenario**: Ultimate test requiring perfect synchronization and advanced reasoning.

#### Master-Level Logic:
- Negative conditionals and proof by contradiction
- Symmetric pattern requirements
- Quantum entanglement-style logical relationships
- Complex theorems requiring deep logical understanding

**Solution**: R1=ON, R2=OFF, R3=OFF, R4=OFF, R5=OFF, R6=OFF, R7=ON, R8=ON
